# Localization

This document describes the current localization model for `autobyteus-web`.

## Overview

The app now localizes product-owned UI through a single client-side runtime.

- Supported locales: `en`, `zh-CN`
- Supported preference modes: `system`, `en`, `zh-CN`
- Default preference: `system`
- English is the fallback catalog for missing keys and bootstrap recovery

The authoritative runtime lives in:

- `localization/runtime/localizationRuntime.ts`
- `plugins/05.localization.client.ts`
- `composables/useLocalization.ts`

## Runtime Behavior

### Bootstrap and First Paint

- The localization plugin initializes before product UI is released.
- `AppLocalizationGate.vue` keeps the app on a neutral boot surface while localization is still booting.
- Once initialization completes, the gate releases the normal app shell.
- If initialization fails, the runtime falls back to English, sets `bootstrapState = 'failed'`, and still releases the app instead of leaving the UI stuck behind the gate.

### Locale Resolution

When the preference is `system`:

- browser mode reads `navigator.languages` and `navigator.language`
- Electron reads `app.getLocale()` through `window.electronAPI.getAppLocale()`

Resolution rules currently normalize to the supported catalog set:

- English variants resolve to `en`
- Simplified Chinese variants such as `zh-CN`, `zh-SG`, and `zh-Hans` resolve to `zh-CN`
- unsupported locales fall back to `en`

### Persistence

- The selected preference mode is stored in browser local storage
- storage key: `autobyteus.localization.preference-mode`
- changing the preference updates the active locale immediately without a reload

## Settings UX

Users can switch language from `Settings -> Language`.

The language section shows:

- the selected preference mode
- the currently resolved active locale
- the three available options: `System`, `English`, `简体中文`

The selection persists across reloads.

## Translation Authoring Rules

Use the shared localization boundary instead of inline product copy.

- In Vue templates, use `$t('translation.key')`
- In `<script setup>`, stores, and composables, use `useLocalization()` and call `t(...)`
- Add new keys to both locale catalogs, with English remaining the fallback source
- Keep product copy in the localization catalogs rather than in feature-local ad hoc string helpers
- For shared shell labels and other product-critical glossary choices, keep the terminology centralized in the shared catalog owner and add durable catalog tests when the wording is user-critical

Current catalog roots live under:

- `localization/messages/en/`
- `localization/messages/zh-CN/`

Generated locale content is layered with manual catalog owners for product-critical wording. When generated copy is not product-appropriate, normalize the shipped wording in the manual locale catalog owners instead of patching copy ad hoc in consuming components.

### Current zh-CN Shared Shell Glossary

The approved Simplified Chinese shared-shell terminology currently includes:

- `shell.navigation.agents` -> `智能体`
- `shell.navigation.agentTeams` -> `智能体团队`
- `shell.mobile.agent` -> `智能体`

Other shared zh-CN product wording normalized during delivery includes consistent use of:

- `运行`
- `工作区`
- `成员`
- `智能体定义`
- `智能体包`

## Required Validation

Before shipping new localized UI work, run the mandatory localization checks from `autobyteus-web/`:

```bash
pnpm guard:localization-boundary
pnpm audit:localization-literals
```

These commands are also wired into the Electron build commands, so packaged builds fail if the localization boundary or literal audit regresses.

The closed audit inventory is declared in `localization/audit/migrationScopes.ts`. The Agent Org scope (`M-014`) covers its management route, shared handoff authoring surface, launch configuration, history, workspace state, and return navigation. It uses strict Vue inspection so static text, placeholders, mixed interpolation text, presentation attributes, displayed error assignments, and constructed script errors cannot bypass the catalog boundary.

For product-critical zh-CN wording, keep durable catalog tests alongside the locale messages. Current regression coverage includes shared shell glossary and action-label consistency checks under:

- `localization/messages/__tests__/`

## Scope Notes

- This foundation is for product-owned UI copy.
- English remains the durable fallback until additional locale catalogs are added.
- Future locales should extend the same runtime/catalog path instead of creating parallel translation systems.
