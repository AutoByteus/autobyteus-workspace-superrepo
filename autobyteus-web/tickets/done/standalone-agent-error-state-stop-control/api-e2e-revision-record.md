# API/E2E Revision Record

The current `api-e2e-coverage-investigation.md` and
`api-e2e-execution-coverage-report.md` are authoritative. This record preserves
the concise validation-round history.

## Revision Index

| Revision ID | Triggering Role / Report / Round | Related Upstream Revision IDs | Prior Result / Confidence | Current Result / Confidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `API-REV-001` | Implementation Engineer / `implementation-handoff.md` / round 1 | `RER-002`, `IR-001`; architecture and code-review revisions `N/A` | N/A | Pass / 99% |

## Revision Entries

### API-REV-001 — Standalone Error Stop executable baseline

- Triggering role, report path, and round: Implementation Engineer; `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/autobyteus-web/tickets/done/standalone-agent-error-state-stop-control/implementation-handoff.md`; API/E2E round 1.
- Triggering finding or scenario IDs: `SCN-001`, `SCN-002`; `AC-001`–`AC-007`.
- Related revision IDs: requirements `RER-002`; implementation `IR-001`; architecture-design, architecture-review, code-review, and delivery revision IDs `N/A — not applicable`.
- Why recorded: establishes the mandatory initial API/E2E result and independent executable proof for the direct `Small` / `Low` implementation.
- Coverage decisions or durable test paths changed:
  - Added `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/autobyteus-server-ts/tests/e2e/agent/standalone-error-termination-lifecycle.e2e.test.ts`.
  - Added `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/autobyteus-web/tests/e2e/fixtures/standalone-agent-error-stop.page.vue`.
  - Added `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/autobyteus-web/tests/e2e/standalone-agent-error-stop-probe.mjs`.
  - Updated `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/autobyteus-web/package.json` with the named probe script.
  - Removed no coverage.
- Scenarios added, changed, removed, or rechecked: added `API-E2E-003` and durable browser `API-E2E-004-A`–`E`; rechecked focused frontend, client mutation owner, supporting server lifecycle, and affected frontend history/Team regressions as `API-E2E-001`, `002`, `005`, and `006`.
- Commands, environment, fixture, or broader-validation delta: prepared shared server packages, ran 73 focused frontend tests, 17 mutation-owner tests, 2 joined server lifecycle tests, 22 supporting server tests, 184 affected frontend tests plus guards, and a named Nuxt/Chromium probe at 1280x800 and 420x760. All passed; isolated processes and generated setup outputs were cleaned.

#### Prior Failure Resolution

None.

- Canonical artifacts updated: coverage investigation, test-case ledger, execution coverage report, and this revision record.
- Prior result and confidence: `N/A`.
- Current result and confidence: `Pass / 99%`.
- New or remaining failure IDs: none.
- Recommended recipient: `/software_engineering_team/delivery_engineer`, subject to `get_handoff_rules` confirmation.
- Remaining risks or untested scope: browser and real backend lifecycle use separate deterministic harnesses; provider-generated Error and Electron-shell execution are intentionally inapplicable. No material residual risk.
