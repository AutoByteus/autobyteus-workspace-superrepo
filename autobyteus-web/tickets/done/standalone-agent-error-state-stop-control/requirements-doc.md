# Requirements Document

## Document Status

- Package identifier: `REQPKG-standalone-agent-error-state-stop-control-20260903`
- Status: `Approved`
- Current requirements revision ID: `RER-002`
- Request / ticket: Standalone agent error-state Stop control
- Requirements owner: Requirements Engineer
- Date: 2026-09-03
- Approval state and reference: Explicitly approved by the requesting user in this thread on 2026-09-03 with the response “approve”; approval applies to the bounded `RER-001` intended behavior, incorporated without behavior change in `RER-002`.

## Problem And Desired Outcome

- Problem: In the workspace history list, a current independent/single-agent run can visibly enter the `Error` state while its runtime remains available for termination, but its row no longer offers the existing Stop/Terminate control. The user therefore cannot intentionally clean up that errored run from the same supported surface. The row may instead expose controls intended for an already inactive run.
- Affected actors or systems: Users operating standalone (non-team) agent runs in the workspace history panel; standalone agent run lifecycle presentation and termination behavior.
- Desired outcome: A current standalone agent run that is in the `Error` state and has not been confirmed inactive remains explicitly stoppable from its history row, with the same safe termination lifecycle and feedback as a healthy active run.
- Observable definition of success: An error-state standalone run that remains termination-eligible displays an accessible Stop control next to its relative time; invoking it dispatches termination once without selecting the row, preserves the row, and transitions to the existing inactive presentation only after successful termination. A failed termination remains actionable and produces visible failure feedback.

## Relevant Current And Desired Behavior

| Behavior ID | Kind (`User`/`System`/`Operational`/`Contract`) | Related Scenario IDs | Evidence-Backed Current Behavior | Desired Behavior | Intentionally Preserved Behavior | Investigation Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BEH-001 | User | SCN-001, SCN-002 | A standalone run row displays the existing Stop control only when its projected `isActive` value is true. A live `Error` context is currently projected as inactive, so the Stop control disappears even though the server's active-runtime projection treats an error-status managed run as active and reconnectable. | A current standalone run in `Error` that has not been authoritatively confirmed inactive remains termination-eligible and displays the existing Stop control. Error status alone must not make the run appear already stopped. | Healthy initializing/running/idle standalone runs remain stoppable; genuinely inactive/offline or successfully terminated history remains non-stoppable. | `investigation-notes.md` sections “Relevant Existing Behavior” and “Relevant Codebase And Technical Facts”; supplied screenshots. |
| BEH-002 | User | SCN-001, SCN-002 | Existing Stop dispatch is guarded per run, does not select the row, preserves history on success, and presents a toast on failure. Inactive persisted rows expose archive/delete actions. | Error-state Stop uses the same observable dispatch, pending, success, and failure behavior. While the errored run remains termination-eligible, inactive-only archive/delete controls are not offered as substitutes or alongside Stop. | Existing button styling, accessible label, failure message pattern, row preservation, inactive archive/delete behavior, and non-selection on action click remain unchanged. | `WorkspaceHistoryWorkspaceSection.vue`; `useWorkspaceHistoryMutations.ts`; `agentRunStore.ts`; current targeted tests. |

## Stakeholders, Actors, And Outcomes

| Actor / Stakeholder | Goal Or Responsibility | Required Outcome | Important Constraint |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| User operating an independent/single agent | Stop and clean up a current run even after the run reports an error | A visible, usable Stop control on a termination-eligible error-state row, followed by truthful success or failure presentation | The presence of an error must not be confused with confirmed termination |
| Product and support | Avoid leaving an errored standalone runtime with no supported termination action | Error-state lifecycle remains recoverable through the existing Stop workflow | This ticket does not change the cause, wording, or recovery policy of runtime/provider errors |
| Engineering and QA | Preserve lifecycle truth and existing interaction safety | Error-state coverage exercises visibility, pending, success, and failure outcomes without regressing healthy or inactive rows | Team-run behavior and backend termination contracts are outside this change boundary |

## Scope Guardrail (Mandatory)

### In-Scope Use Cases

- `UC-001`: A current standalone agent run enters `Error` while it remains eligible for termination; the user can Stop it from its workspace history row.
- `UC-002`: Termination of an error-state standalone run succeeds or fails, and the row reflects the authoritative outcome without losing history or exposing misleading actions.
- `UC-003`: Existing standalone row action safety is preserved for healthy active and confirmed-inactive states.

### Out Of Scope

- Agent Team, nested-team, team-member, or delegated-task Stop behavior.
- Changes to authentication, access-token refresh, provider error diagnosis, sign-in recovery, retry/resume, or error-message content.
- New backend termination APIs, lifecycle contracts, persistence schemas, deployment behavior, or migrations.
- Changing archive/delete policy for genuinely inactive standalone run history.
- Adding a second Stop location in the conversation header or center panel.

### Non-Goals

- Do not automatically terminate a run when it enters `Error`.
- Do not treat every historical record that merely contains past error evidence as currently stoppable.
- Do not remove or hide the visible error state before termination is confirmed.
- Do not redesign the row, iconography, notifications, or workspace navigation.

### Preserved Behavior Boundary

- Preserve BEH-002 and AC-003 through AC-006: one termination attempt per user action, per-run pending protection, row-action click isolation, failure feedback, row retention, and the existing confirmed-inactive action model.
- Healthy active standalone runs continue to show Stop. Confirmed inactive/offline or terminated runs do not show Stop merely because their history contains an earlier error.

### Review Authority

- Every blocking `Design Impact` or implementation-correction finding must cite an approved requirement, acceptance criterion, or preserved-behavior ID that it protects.
- A finding that would introduce new product behavior, policy, threat model, migration obligation, compatibility promise, or operational contract is a `Requirement Gap`; it requires explicit user approval before becoming authoritative.
- An adjacent concern outside the approved boundary may be recorded as a non-blocking risk, recommendation, or separate-ticket candidate. It is not a required design correction.
- A downstream reviewer comment does not amend this requirements basis. The Requirements Engineer must update the canonical requirements and obtain renewed user approval before a scope-changing proposal can govern design or implementation.

## Requirements

| Requirement ID | Requirement | Related Behavior IDs | Priority / Criticality | Rationale | Source / Decision Reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| REQ-001 | The workspace history row for a current standalone agent run shall display its existing Stop/Terminate control when the run is in the `Error` state and remains eligible for termination. | BEH-001 | Must | Error is a visible runtime status, not sufficient evidence that lifecycle cleanup has completed. | User request and screenshots; SCN-001 |
| REQ-002 | Stop eligibility shall remain distinct from the displayed health/status value: an error-state run shall remain stoppable until termination succeeds or an authoritative lifecycle result establishes that it is inactive. | BEH-001 | Must | Prevents error presentation from falsely removing the only supported cleanup action while avoiding Stop on genuinely historical/inactive rows. | Backend active-runtime projection evidence; SCN-001, SCN-002 |
| REQ-003 | Invoking Stop for an error-state standalone run shall use the existing standalone termination behavior: one dispatch for the exact run, no row selection side effect, and a disabled exact Stop control while that request is pending. | BEH-002 | Must | Preserves current interaction and duplicate-request safeguards. | Existing healthy-run behavior; SCN-001 |
| REQ-004 | Successful termination shall preserve the run's history row, remove its Stop eligibility, and expose only the existing actions appropriate to its confirmed inactive source/state. | BEH-002 | Must | Cleanup must be visible and must not destroy history. | Existing termination behavior; SCN-001 |
| REQ-005 | Failed or rejected termination shall keep the error-state run visible and termination-eligible after pending state clears, shall not present it as successfully stopped, and shall provide the existing user-visible termination failure feedback. | BEH-002 | Must | Users need truthful feedback and a retryable supported action. | Existing failure contract; SCN-002 |
| REQ-006 | While an error-state standalone run remains termination-eligible, controls reserved for confirmed-inactive persisted history (archive/delete) shall not replace or appear alongside Stop. | BEH-001, BEH-002 | Must | Prevents mutually contradictory lifecycle actions and accidental destructive handling of a current runtime. | Current active/inactive mutual-exclusion pattern; user screenshot |
| REQ-007 | The error-state Stop control shall retain the existing button semantics and accessible name/tooltip used by standalone Stop. | BEH-002 | Should | The newly covered state must remain keyboard-operable and understandable without introducing a new interaction pattern. | Existing row control behavior |

## Acceptance Criteria

| Acceptance-Criteria ID | Related Requirement IDs | Related Behavior / Scenario IDs | Preconditions / Trigger | Observable Expected Outcome | Important Alternate Or Failure Outcome | Verification Intent |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AC-001 | REQ-001, REQ-002, REQ-006, REQ-007 | BEH-001 / SCN-001 | A current standalone run is displayed with status `Error` and remains termination-eligible. | The row shows one Stop/Terminate button next to its relative time, with the existing accessible name/tooltip, while preserving the red error status presentation; inactive-only archive/delete controls are absent. | A confirmed inactive row with only past error evidence does not gain Stop. | Component test using error-state current-run and confirmed-inactive fixtures; rendered DOM/accessibility assertion. |
| AC-002 | REQ-003 | BEH-002 / SCN-001 | The user activates Stop on the error-state row. | Exactly one termination request is dispatched for that run; the row itself is not selected/opened by the action click. | Repeated activation while the request is pending does not dispatch another request. | Component/composable interaction test with dispatch and selection spies. |
| AC-003 | REQ-003 | BEH-002 / SCN-001 | Termination for the exact error-state run is pending. | The exact Stop control is disabled until that attempt settles. | Other independent row controls are not incorrectly marked pending. | Component test with a deferred termination promise. |
| AC-004 | REQ-004 | BEH-002 / SCN-001 | Termination returns a confirmed success. | The history row remains, its Stop control disappears, its state no longer claims an active/error runtime, and the existing inactive actions appropriate to its persisted/draft source become available. | No backend success is inferred from UI status alone. | Store plus component integration test across success settlement and history refresh/transition. |
| AC-005 | REQ-005 | BEH-002 / SCN-002 | Termination returns `success: false`, GraphQL errors, or throws. | The row remains visible without a false inactive/success transition; after pending clears, Stop is available again and the existing “Failed to terminate run. Please try again.” error toast is shown. | Destructive inactive-only controls remain unavailable while the run is still termination-eligible. | Store/composable/component failure tests. |
| AC-006 | REQ-001, REQ-002 | BEH-001 / SCN-001 | The run is healthy and active, error-state and termination-eligible, or authoritatively inactive. | Healthy active and error-state termination-eligible rows show Stop; authoritatively inactive/offline rows do not. | No Agent Team row or team termination behavior changes. | State matrix regression test covering initializing/running/idle/error/offline and standalone/team boundaries. |
| AC-007 | REQ-007 | BEH-002 / SCN-001 | Keyboard focus reaches the error-state Stop button. | The control is operable as a native button and exposes the existing localized termination label. | Pending state is conveyed by the disabled button behavior. | DOM accessibility assertion and keyboard activation test. |

## Relevant Scenarios And Journeys

| Scenario ID | Kind (`User`/`System`/`Operational`/`Contract`) | Actor / Initiator / Governing Contract | Coherent Goal Or Governing Event | Supported Trigger / Entry Surface | Starting Condition | Product-Level Steps Or Event Sequence | Expected Outcome | Supported Alternate / Error Behavior | Scenario Validity | Independent Evidence / Decision Reference | Related Requirement / AC IDs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SCN-001 | User | User operating a standalone agent run | Stop an errored current run that still requires lifecycle cleanup | Existing Stop action area on the standalone run's row in Workspaces history | The standalone row is current, visibly `Error`, and not authoritatively inactive/terminated | 1. The run enters `Error`. 2. The row retains the error indication and shows Stop. 3. The user activates Stop. 4. The exact control becomes pending. 5. Termination succeeds. | The retained row transitions to confirmed inactive presentation; Stop disappears and only existing inactive actions appropriate to the row are offered. | Duplicate activation is blocked while pending. | `Supported Normal Scenario` | Explicit user request and paired screenshots; existing healthy-run Stop workflow | REQ-001–REQ-004, REQ-006–REQ-007 / AC-001–AC-004, AC-006–AC-007 |
| SCN-002 | User | User operating a standalone agent run | Recover when attempting to stop the errored current run fails | Same error-state Stop control | The error-state run is termination-eligible and a termination attempt can fail | 1. User activates Stop. 2. The attempt fails or is rejected. 3. The UI presents failure feedback without claiming success. 4. Pending clears and Stop remains available. | The user can see that the run was not confirmed stopped and can retry the supported action. | Existing failure toast is used; row and error evidence remain visible. | `Supported Explicit Edge Scenario` | Existing `agentRunStore.terminateRun` boolean failure contract and existing user-visible failure test | REQ-003, REQ-005, REQ-006 / AC-002, AC-003, AC-005 |

## UI, Interaction, And Experience Requirements

- Applicable: `Yes`
- Linked UI/UX or interaction supplement: N/A — the request specifies extension of an existing row control; current-state screenshots are listed as evidence below.
- Linked runnable prototype, separate prototype repository/root, UI/UX specification, and applicable support artifacts: N/A — not applicable; Product Design & Prototyping was not requested.
- Product prototype ticket record and folder (externally owned): N/A — not applicable.
- Prototype revision or commit: N/A — not applicable.
- UI/UX user-confirmation reference: No prototype applies; the requesting user approved the existing-control behavior in this thread on 2026-09-03.
- Approved visual-reference baseline: N/A — no future-state visual prototype; supplied screenshots document current error and healthy states.
- Normative visual and interaction details, including the approved final references: Reuse the existing standalone Stop button's placement, icon treatment, native-button behavior, accessible label/tooltip, pending disablement, and row-action click isolation. The red error indicator and error content remain visible until authoritative state changes.
- Explicitly illustrative fixture content or permitted implementation variation: Agent names, summaries, timestamps, provider-specific error text, and workspace names in the screenshots are illustrative only.
- Required screens, states, transitions, feedback, responsive behavior, or accessibility outcomes: Workspace history standalone run row; error/termination-eligible, pending, termination-success, termination-failure, healthy-active, and confirmed-inactive states; native keyboard operation and localized accessible name.
- Explicitly unresolved product decisions: None material to the requested behavior.

## Quality And Non-Functional Requirements

| Quality ID | Area (`Performance`/`Reliability`/`Security`/`Privacy`/`Accessibility`/`Compliance`/`Operability`/`Compatibility`/`Other`) | Measurable Requirement Or Constraint | Conditions / Scope | Verification Intent |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| QR-001 | Reliability | Error display and termination eligibility must not be conflated; a failed termination produces no false stopped state and remains retryable. | Standalone error-state Stop lifecycle | Failure-path state assertions in AC-005 |
| QR-002 | Accessibility | The newly covered error-state control remains a native keyboard-operable button with the existing localized accessible termination name, and pending is represented through disabled state. | Workspace history row in error state | AC-007 DOM and keyboard assertions |
| QR-003 | Compatibility | Existing healthy-active, confirmed-inactive, draft/history, and Agent Team row behavior remains unchanged except where the approved standalone error-state matrix explicitly differs. | Workspace history action rendering and termination flow | AC-006 regression matrix and current targeted suite |

## Data Continuity And Acceptable Loss

- Persisted or external data affected: `No`
- Data or state that must be preserved: Existing standalone run history row, summary, conversation/history content, and failure evidence; current termination behavior records successful termination through existing mechanisms.
- Loss, reset, rebuild, or regeneration that is acceptable: No additional data loss or reset is authorized. Existing local runtime teardown after confirmed termination is intentionally preserved.
- Retention, privacy, compliance, volume, downtime, or operational constraints: No new requirements identified.
- Unknowns requiring downstream investigation: None material; downstream implementation must verify the selected lifecycle/eligibility signal without changing persistence or API contracts.

## External Contracts And Dependencies

| Contract / Dependency | Required Behavior Or Constraint | Evidence / Authority | Uncertainty Or Risk |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Existing standalone termination mutation result | UI must treat only a confirmed successful termination result as success and retain existing failure feedback otherwise. | `autobyteus-web/graphql/mutations/agentMutations.ts`; `autobyteus-web/stores/agentRunStore.ts` | No contract change is authorized. |
| Existing backend active-runtime status projection | A managed runtime can report status `error` while `isActive` and `shouldConnectStream` are true. | `autobyteus-server-ts/src/agent-execution/services/agent-run-status-projection-service.ts` | Frontend live-context projection currently conflicts with this distinction. |

## Supplemental Artifacts

| Artifact Path | Purpose | Related Requirement / AC IDs | Status | Approval Applicability / State |

| `/home/autobyteus/data/memory/agent_teams/software_development_department_03636d7482c04940987839d4fb0868a6/requirements_engineer_3bce6dff03fa4f379b8a458ec801ff6e/context_files/ctx_09ce9b073f2e__image.png` | Current-state comparison: a healthy selected standalone run shows the Stop control next to “now.” | REQ-001, REQ-007 / AC-001 | Supplied evidence | Informational current-state evidence; not a future-state visual specification |

## Assumptions

| Assumption ID | Assumption | Why It Is Necessary | Validation Plan / Owner | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ASM-001 | “Independent or single agent run” means standalone agent runs, not Agent Team runs or member executions. | Defines the user's explicit boundary and prevents unrelated team behavior changes. | User approval of this package / Requirements Engineer | Accepted by package approval on 2026-09-03 |
| ASM-002 | The intended Stop control is the existing small row-level Stop/Terminate control shown next to the relative time in the healthy-state screenshot. | Avoids inventing a new location or redesign. | User approval of this package / Requirements Engineer | Accepted by package approval on 2026-09-03 |
| ASM-003 | An error-state row should be stoppable only while it represents a current/managed or otherwise termination-eligible run; stale historical error evidence alone should not expose Stop. | Prevents misleading calls against genuinely inactive history while satisfying the reported case. | User approval plus downstream verification | Accepted by package approval on 2026-09-03; implementation verification pending |

## Open Decisions And Questions

| Decision / Question ID | Question | Why It Matters | Options / Evidence | Decision Owner | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DEC-001 | Is the bounded behavior above—standalone error-state current runs only, reusing the existing row Stop control and leaving Agent Teams unchanged—approved? | Explicit approval is required before downstream routing. | User replied “approve” in this thread on 2026-09-03. | User | Decided — approved |

## Traceability

| Requirement ID | Behavior IDs | Acceptance-Criteria IDs | Scenario IDs | Supplemental / Prototype Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| REQ-001 | BEH-001 | AC-001, AC-006 | SCN-001 | Both supplied screenshots |
| REQ-002 | BEH-001 | AC-001, AC-006 | SCN-001, SCN-002 | Investigation code evidence; no prototype |
| REQ-003 | BEH-002 | AC-002, AC-003 | SCN-001, SCN-002 | Existing targeted tests; no prototype |
| REQ-004 | BEH-002 | AC-004 | SCN-001 | Existing store termination behavior; no prototype |
| REQ-005 | BEH-002 | AC-005 | SCN-002 | Existing failure test and store behavior; no prototype |
| REQ-006 | BEH-001, BEH-002 | AC-001, AC-005 | SCN-001, SCN-002 | Error screenshot and row action template |
| REQ-007 | BEH-002 | AC-001, AC-007 | SCN-001 | Healthy-state screenshot and existing button semantics |

## Downstream Architecture Input

- Approved scenario IDs and product-level behavior paths architecture must map: SCN-001 and SCN-002.
- Product and system constraints architecture must preserve: Error status remains visibly distinct from confirmed inactivity; only confirmed termination changes the row to inactive; exact-run dispatch, pending guard, row preservation, and failure feedback remain intact; team behavior remains out of scope.
- Decisions intentionally deferred to architecture design: None identified. The post-approval routing assessment selected bounded direct implementation.
- Technical facts architecture should verify: Frontend live-context status conversion currently maps `Error` to `isActive: false`; row actions are gated by `run.isActive`; backend projection distinguishes active runtime from error status and existing termination acts on manager-owned active runs.
- Known feasibility or integration risks: Eligibility must be derived from a truthful lifecycle source so Stop is not shown for a genuinely inactive historical row. No new API or persistence behavior is authorized.

## Readiness Check

- Relevant current behavior is evidence-backed: `Yes`
- Desired and preserved behavior are explicit: `Yes`
- Scope and non-goals are clear: `Yes`
- Requirements and acceptance criteria are testable and traceable: `Yes`
- Applicable scenarios are covered with validity and evidence: `Yes`
- Prototype and supplemental evidence is integrated consistently: `Yes`
- Applicable UI/UX approval and final visual-reference basis are recorded: `N/A`
- Material assumptions and open decisions are visible: `Yes`
- User approval received: `Yes` — requesting user replied “approve” on 2026-09-03.
- Requirements package ready for downstream route: `Yes`
- Remaining blocker: None.

## Architecture Design Routing Assessment

- Assessment status: `Complete`
- Assessment owner and date: Requirements Engineer / 2026-09-03
- Preliminary task size: `Small`
- Preliminary architectural risk: `Low`
- Structural surfaces reviewed: Standalone run tree/read-model status projection, live-context overlay, history-row action eligibility, the existing termination/pending/feedback boundary, and the backend active-runtime status and termination contracts.
- Payload/content surfaces reviewed: Existing localized Stop/Terminate label and existing failure-toast content; no new payload or content surface is required.
- Structural-impact triggers: `None`
- Evidence paths: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/autobyteus-web/tickets/done/standalone-agent-error-state-stop-control/investigation-notes.md`; source paths and targeted baseline command recorded there.
- Decision rationale: The approved outcome aligns the standalone history presentation with an existing lifecycle distinction and reuses the existing exact-run termination action, pending guard, feedback, and backend contract. No API/external contract, persisted schema/invariant, security/privacy boundary, concurrency mechanism, runtime lifecycle transition, deployment topology, subsystem ownership, migration, new architectural pattern, or structural refactor is required by the approved behavior. The bounded change can proceed without an architecture-owned decision; Implementation Engineer must recheck this conclusion against implementation evidence.
- Selected route: `Implementation Engineer`
- Outcome classification: `Approved Direct-Implementation`
- Direct-route conditions all satisfied: `Yes`
- Architecture design, review, and design-revision artifacts: `N/A — not applicable`
- Downstream re-entry trigger: Implementation evidence showing a structural Design Impact or a Requirement Gap must be returned through the configured recovery route; otherwise proceed through bounded implementation and validation.
