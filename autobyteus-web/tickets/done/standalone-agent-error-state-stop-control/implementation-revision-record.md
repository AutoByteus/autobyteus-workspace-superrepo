# Implementation Revision Record

The current code and `implementation-handoff.md` are authoritative. This record
locates the initial implementation baseline and any later implementation deltas.

## Revision Index

## Revision Entries

### IR-001 — Error-state standalone Stop baseline

- Triggering role, report path, and round: Requirements Engineer; `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/autobyteus-web/tickets/done/standalone-agent-error-state-stop-control/requirements-doc.md`; initial implementation.
- Triggering finding IDs: `N/A`.
- Classification: `Initial Baseline`.
- Prior authoritative result: `N/A`.
- Current authoritative result: Approved standalone Error rows remain visibly errored and show the existing row Stop control only when their lifecycle projection remains active; confirmed-inactive Error history remains non-stoppable. Existing exact-run pending, success, failure, history-retention, and inactive-action behavior is reused.
- Related architecture design revision IDs: `N/A — not applicable`.
- Related architecture-review revision IDs: `N/A — not applicable`.
- Related code-review revision IDs: `N/A`.
- Related API/E2E revision IDs: `N/A`.
- Related delivery revision IDs: `N/A`.
- Why this baseline or implementation revision is recorded: Establishes the required initial implementation handoff baseline for approved requirements revision `RER-002`.
- Approved behavior or requirement IDs affected: `BEH-001`, `BEH-002`; `REQ-001` through `REQ-007`; `AC-001` through `AC-007`; `SCN-001`, `SCN-002`.
- Implementation delta:
  - Current local/draft Error status now projects as active/termination-eligible while Offline remains inactive.
  - A live Error overlay preserves the persisted row's authoritative `isActive` value rather than forcing either activity or inactivity; this keeps active Error rows stoppable without reactivating historical Error rows.
  - The existing standalone row Stop button now has an explicit localized accessible name and stable test selectors; its placement, icon, styling, pending behavior, and click isolation are unchanged.
  - Focused read-model, live-overlay, UI state-matrix, exact dispatch, pending, confirmed-success, rejected/throwing failure, history-retention, and inactive-action tests were added or revised.
- Changed files or areas: `autobyteus-web/utils/runTreeLiveStatusMerge.ts`; `autobyteus-web/stores/runHistoryReadModel.ts`; `autobyteus-web/components/workspace/history/WorkspaceHistoryWorkspaceSection.vue`; corresponding focused tests.
- Local validation and result: 73 focused projection/read-model/component tests passed; 17 existing `agentRunStore` lifecycle tests passed; localization and web-boundary guards passed; Chromium development-renderer inspection passed for initial, pending, success, failure/retry, keyboard, accessibility, and narrow-layout states. Repository-wide Nuxt typecheck remains red from 3,156 existing diagnostics, with no diagnostics naming the six changed source/test files.
- Next recipient or routing: Rule-selected downstream validation for the confirmed `Small` / `Low` direct route.
- Remaining limitations or risks: Independent API/E2E validation remains required. Repository-wide typecheck is not a usable green signal on this baseline.
