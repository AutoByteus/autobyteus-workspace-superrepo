# AutoByteus Web - Documentation & Developer Guide

Welcome to the AutoByteus Web documentation. This project is structured around distinct "Concerns"—modular functional areas that interact to create the full application. Think of this documentation as a book, where each chapter covers a specific concern or architectural layer.

## 📚 Documentation Catalog

### Chapter 1: Architecture & Foundation
Understanding the system's backbone, how the pieces fit together, and how the application is delivered.

*   **[System Architecture](./ARCHITECTURE.md)**: The high-level map of the system, defining the frontend, backend, and Electron integration. Start here.
*   **[Agent Execution Architecture](./docs/agent_execution_architecture.md)**: A deep dive into the runtime behavior—how user input flows to agents and how streaming responses are parsed and rendered.
*   **[Electron Packaging & Server Management](./docs/electron_packaging.md)**: How the web app and Python backend are bundled into a single desktop executable.
*   **[Testing Strategy](./ARCHITECTURE.md#testing-strategy)**: Our approach to quality assurance, including test colocation and tools.

### Chapter 2: Core Entities (The "Brain")
The primary actors and capabilities within the system.

*   **[Agent Management](./docs/agent_management.md)**: How single agents are defined, configured, and managed.
*   **[Agent Teams](./docs/agent_teams.md)**: Defining and running reusable flat coordinator-led Teams.
*   **[Agent Orgs](./docs/agent_orgs.md)**: Composing direct Agents and reusable flat Teams into coordinator-free organizations.
*   **[Skills](./docs/skills.md)**: Reusable, file-based capabilities (scripts) that agents can learn.
*   **[Tools & MCP](./docs/tools_and_mcp.md)**: External tools and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration for expanding agent capabilities.
*   **[Prompt Engineering](./docs/prompt_engineering.md)**: Managing the system prompts that define agent personas and behaviors.

### Chapter 3: Interface & Environment (The "Body")
The tools and environments where agents live and users interact.

*   **[File Explorer](./docs/file_explorer.md)**: The file system interface, workspace management, and real-time synchronization.
*   **[Terminal](./docs/terminal.md)**: The integrated terminal emulator for executing system commands.
*   **[Content Rendering](./docs/content_rendering.md)**: How the system displays rich content like Markdown, Code, and Mermaid diagrams.
*   **[Settings](./docs/settings.md)**: Application configuration, API key management, and system monitoring.

## 🛠️ Developer Guidelines

### Git Guidelines
*   **NEVER use `git add .` or `git add -A`**. Always stage files individually or by specific patterns to avoid committing unintended changes.

### Release Guidelines
*   Keep desktop release tag and package version in sync:
    * `autobyteus-web/package.json` version must match release tag version (`vX.Y.Z`).
*   Prefer the root helper script to avoid drift:
    * `pnpm release <x.y.z>`: normal new personal release path. It bumps the version, creates the release commit, creates the tag, and pushes branch + tag.
    * `pnpm release:test --ref personal`: build-only validation path. This does **not** publish a release.
    * `pnpm release:manual-dispatch v<x.y.z> --ref personal`: manual workflow-dispatch path for an **existing** tag or a recovery/retry case.
*   Canonical new release flow:
    * `1.` merge finished work into `personal`
    * `2.` run `pnpm release <x.y.z>`
    * `3.` stop there and monitor the single tag-push release workflow started by the pushed `v<x.y.z>` tag
*   Important:
    * `release` already starts the real release workflow by pushing the tag.
    * Do **not** run `release:manual-dispatch` immediately after a fresh `release` for the same version.
    * Doing both creates two release jobs for the same release: one `push` run from the tag and one `workflow_dispatch` run from the manual dispatch command.
*   Use `release:manual-dispatch` only when:
    * the tag already exists and you intentionally need a manual re-publish
    * the previous release workflow needs recovery without creating a new version
*   Do not create release tags manually unless there is an explicit exception.

### Testing Overview
We follow a **colocated testing strategy** where tests live alongside the code in `__tests__` directories.
*   **Philosophy**: See **[Testing Strategy in Architecture](./ARCHITECTURE.md#testing-strategy)**.
*   **Key Commands**:
    *   `pnpm test`: Run all tests (Nuxt + Electron).
    *   `pnpm test:nuxt`: Run only web/frontend tests (Recommended). **Always include `--run` to avoid watch mode timeouts**.
    *   `pnpm test:electron`: Run only Electron-specific tests.
    *   `pnpm -C autobyteus-server-ts exec vitest run tests/unit/config/app-config.test.ts --no-watch`: Run a single server test file.
    *   *Note: Always use `--run` (e.g., `pnpm test:nuxt path/to/test --run`) to execute once without watch mode.*
*   **Full Guide**: See **[Testing in README](./README.md#testing)**.
