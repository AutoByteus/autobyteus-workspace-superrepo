## Revision Entries

### CRR-001 — Initial implementation review identifies migration and Org-edit correctness gaps

- Canonical review report updated: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/.codex/worktrees/flat-agent-organization-model/tickets/in-progress/flat-agent-organization-model/code-review-report.md`
- Review entry point and round: `Implementation Review`, round `1`
- Triggering role, report path, and finding or scenario IDs: Implementation Engineer / `implementation-handoff.md` / `CR-SCN-001`–`003`, `CR-FIND-001`–`003`
- Relevant architecture design revision IDs: `AD-REV-005`
- Relevant architecture-review revision IDs: `ARCH-REV-003`
- Relevant implementation revision IDs: `IR-002`
- Relevant API/E2E revision IDs: `N/A — pending`
- Relevant delivery revision IDs: `N/A — pending`
- Prior authoritative result: `N/A`
- Current authoritative result: `Fail — Local Fix; return to Implementation Engineer`
- What changed in the review result and why: Established the initial code-review baseline. Independent source tracing and reviewer probes found that definition conversion writes before complete preflight, prospective definition state cannot resume after ordinary interruption/restart, and Org edit clears hidden durable fields.
- Supported product scenario / material-premise basis changes: No upstream behavior changed. The findings use explicit migration failure/relaunch contracts and the normal Org authoring/configuration journeys. `AR-PREM-001` remains confirmed but is contradicted by the implementation.

#### Prior Finding Resolution

None.

- New or remaining finding IDs: `CR-FIND-001`, `CR-FIND-002`, `CR-FIND-003`
- Material score or classification changes: Initial score `8.7/10 (86.6/100)`; classification `Local Fix`.
- Recommended recipient: `implementation_engineer`
- Remaining risks or uncertainty: API/E2E and delivery remain pending; repository-wide unrelated baselines remain as documented by IR-002.

### CRR-002 — Fixed-depth premise and migration-convention reconsideration

- Canonical review report updated: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/.codex/worktrees/flat-agent-organization-model/tickets/in-progress/flat-agent-organization-model/code-review-report.md`
- Review entry point and round: `Implementation Review reconsideration`, round `2`
- Triggering role, report path, and finding or scenario IDs: User clarification / `code-review-report.md` / `CR-SCN-001`, `CR-SCN-002`, `CR-FIND-001`, `CR-FIND-002`
- Relevant architecture design revision IDs: `AD-REV-005`
- Relevant architecture-review revision IDs: `ARCH-REV-003`
- Relevant implementation revision IDs: `IR-002` (source unchanged)
- Relevant API/E2E revision IDs: `N/A — pending`
- Relevant delivery revision IDs: `N/A — pending`
- Prior authoritative result: `CRR-001 / Fail — Local Fix`
- Current authoritative result: `Fail — Local Fix; findings unchanged`
- What changed in the review result and why: Rechecked the user's fixed-depth premise against current data, requirements history, the design, and `production_data_migration_conventions.md`. The read-only inventory confirms 45 readable runtime roots (`27` flat, `18` one-level, none deeper), one writable server definition root with no child, and 23 external roots with no grandchild Team. This confirms `PRE-002` and that no deep conversion is required. It does not invalidate `CR-FIND-001`, because `REQ-013`, `QR-003`, RER-004, and the approved design explicitly require an unexpected violation to fail before any write. It strengthens `CR-FIND-002`, because the convention explicitly requires one ordinary interruption/relaunch path and that finding uses a valid one-level definition.
- Supported product scenario / material-premise basis changes: Inventory evidence was refreshed; scenario classification remains `Supported Explicit Edge`. No new behavior or machinery was added.

#### Prior Finding Resolution

| Finding ID | Prior Status | Current Status | Related Revision References | Verification Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `CR-FIND-001` | `Open` | `Open` | `PRE-002`, `REQ-013`, `QR-003`, RER-004, `AD-REV-005` | Fresh inventory confirms no current deeper data; the explicit zero-write invariant remains authoritative and the production method still writes before complete preflight. |
| `CR-FIND-002` | `Open` | `Open` | Migration convention “Abrupt Termination”; `AR-PREM-001`; `AD-REV-005` | Valid one-level interruption probe still fails ordinary retry; deeper topology is not involved. |
| `CR-FIND-003` | `Open` | `Open` | `REQ-012`, `REQ-023`, `REQ-024` | Unaffected by the migration clarification; source unchanged. |

- New or remaining finding IDs: `CR-FIND-001`, `CR-FIND-002`, `CR-FIND-003`
- Material score or classification changes: None; score remains `8.7/10 (86.6/100)`, classification `Local Fix`.
- Recommended recipient: `implementation_engineer`
- Remaining risks or uncertainty: If product intent is instead that `PRE-002` removes even the explicit unexpected-violation validation obligation, Requirements Engineering must revise `REQ-013`, `AC-008`, `QR-003`, and the approved design; Code Review cannot silently waive them.

### CRR-003 — IR-003 resolves migration and Org-edit findings

- Canonical review report updated: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/.codex/worktrees/flat-agent-organization-model/tickets/in-progress/flat-agent-organization-model/code-review-report.md`
- Review entry point and round: `Implementation Review`, round `3`
- Triggering role, report path, and finding or scenario IDs: Implementation Engineer / `implementation-handoff.md` / `CR-SCN-001`–`003`, `CR-FIND-001`–`003`
- Relevant architecture design revision IDs: `AD-REV-005`
- Relevant architecture-review revision IDs: `ARCH-REV-003`
- Relevant implementation revision IDs: `IR-003`
- Relevant API/E2E revision IDs: `N/A — pending`
- Relevant delivery revision IDs: `N/A — pending`
- Prior authoritative result: `CRR-002 / Fail — Local Fix`
- Current authoritative result: `Pass — ready for API/E2E`
- What changed in the review result and why: IR-003 added complete definition preflight, exact prospective-state relaunch, bounded failure reasons, and create/edit payload separation. Source tracing, focused tests, implementation build evidence, and independent reviewer probes verify all prior findings resolved without design change.
- Supported product scenario / material-premise basis changes: None. The same supported scenarios now produce their approved outcomes; `AR-PREM-001` remains confirmed and satisfied.

#### Prior Finding Resolution

| Finding ID | Prior Status | Current Status | Related Revision References | Verification Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `CR-FIND-001` | `Open` | `Resolved` | `IR-003`; `PRE-002`, `REQ-013`, `QR-003`, `AD-REV-005` | `planOrgDefinition()` completes child/Org/markdown/destination preflight before the write loop. Reviewer deeper-child probe leaves the earlier child legacy; focused test asserts byte-faithful source files and exact member/path reason. |
| `CR-FIND-002` | `Open` | `Resolved` | `IR-003`; `AR-PREM-001`; migration convention | Planner recognizes exact V2 children and exact matching prospective Org config/markdown. Reviewer subprocess exits `77` after first child commit, then ordinary retry returns `SUCCEEDED`, removes source, and creates target; two focused relaunch tests pass. |
| `CR-FIND-003` | `Open` | `Resolved` | `IR-003`; `REQ-012`, `REQ-023`, `REQ-024` | Edit sends only `visibleInput`; backend preserves omitted values. Component fixture uses nonempty hidden fields and asserts omission plus ordered handoffs. |

- New or remaining finding IDs: `None`
- Material score or classification changes: Score improves from `8.7/10 (86.6/100)` to `9.2/10 (91.7/100)`; `Local Fix` failure is replaced by clean `Pass`.
- Recommended recipient: Primary `/software_engineering_team/api_e2e_engineer`; informational `/software_engineering_team/implementation_engineer` after primary handoff succeeds.
- Remaining risks or uncertainty: Independent API/E2E and delivery remain pending; documented unrelated full-suite baselines and separate external definition publication remain outside this pass.
