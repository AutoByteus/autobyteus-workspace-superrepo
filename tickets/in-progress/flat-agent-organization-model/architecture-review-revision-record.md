# Architecture Review Revision Record

The latest `design-review-report.md` remains authoritative. This record is the
concise chronological architecture-review history.

## Revision Index

| Revision ID | Review Round / Trigger | Related Architecture Design Revision IDs | Prior Decision | Current Decision | Affected Finding IDs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ARCH-REV-001 | Round 1 / independent review requested after approved `RER-016`, Product `RV-012`, and completed `AD-REV-002` | `AD-REV-001`, `AD-REV-002` | N/A | Fail — Design Impact | `AR-FIND-001`, `AR-FIND-002` |

## Revision Entries

### ARCH-REV-001 — Initial two-family architecture review baseline

- Canonical design review report: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/.codex/worktrees/flat-agent-organization-model/tickets/in-progress/flat-agent-organization-model/design-review-report.md`
- Review round and trigger: Round 1; Architecture Designer completed the cumulative Large/High `AD-REV-002` package and selected independent Architecture Review.
- Triggering role, report path, and finding IDs: Architecture Designer; `/home/autobyteus/workspace/.codex/worktrees/flat-agent-organization-model/tickets/in-progress/flat-agent-organization-model/design-spec.md`; triggering architecture-review findings were created in this round as `AR-FIND-001` and `AR-FIND-002`.
- Relevant architecture design revision IDs: `AD-REV-001`, `AD-REV-002`
- Prior authoritative decision: `N/A`
- Current authoritative decision: `Fail — Design Impact`
- What changed in the review result or what baseline was established: Established the initial independent review baseline. The approved behavior/current-state basis, Large/High route, exact Team V2 preservation, separate Org V1 ownership, tagged mixed projections, migration transaction, task/config/focus boundaries, atomic parent save, and RV-012 production mapping were reviewed. Two implementation-blocking design inconsistencies remain: the target Team definition codec is not connected to current flat Team files, and the target Org/Team-local handoff merge reverses current effective rule order.

#### Prior Finding Resolution

None.

- New or remaining finding IDs: `AR-FIND-001`, `AR-FIND-002`
- Material classification changes: Initial result is `Fail / Design Impact`; no Requirement Gap, Product gap, or routing-classification change.
- Recommended recipient: `/software_engineering_team/architecture_designer`
- Remaining risks or uncertainty: Existing High architecture risks remain controlled in the design but are not implementation-ready until both findings are resolved and independently rechecked. No finding depends on an unsupported material premise.
