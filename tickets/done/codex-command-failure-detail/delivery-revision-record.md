## Revision Entries

### DR-001 — Latest-base README conflict blocks integrated delivery

- Delivery round and trigger: Initial delivery round after the direct low-risk `IR-001` package passed `API-REV-001` at 98% confidence.
- Triggering upstream report, verification, or evidence: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/codex-command-failure-detail/api-e2e-execution-coverage-report.md`; API/E2E commit `005aa4f84a3315d467f949c40ff86afd9872599a`.
- Prior authoritative result (`N/A` for `DR-001`): `N/A`.
- Current authoritative result: `Blocked — Local Fix`. The mandatory merge of latest `origin/personal@ad63d74275a4eb204ebc6d97a2260aa9790fea52` stopped on one additive conflict in `autobyteus-web/README.md`. Carried classification remains `task_size=Small`, `architectural_risk=Low`, selected route `Direct Low-Risk`.
- Docs sync report: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/codex-command-failure-detail/docs-sync-report.md` — blocked; no long-lived project doc synchronized.
- Handoff summary: `N/A — not created because the branch is not yet integrated and checked`.
- Release/publication/deployment report: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/codex-command-failure-detail/release-deployment-report.md`.
- Integration and post-integration verification: Fetch passed and advanced the base by eight commits. `git merge --no-edit origin/personal` stopped on `autobyteus-web/README.md`; no conflict resolution was attempted by Delivery and no post-integration executable check ran. Evidence: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/codex-command-failure-detail/delivery-evidence/dr-001-integration-refresh.log`.
- User verification/finalization state: Not eligible. User verification was not requested; ticket remains in progress; no push, target merge, archive, version/tag, release, deployment, or cleanup occurred.
- Terminal return to `/requirements_engineer`: `Not yet eligible`.
- Terminal return message/reference: `N/A`.
- Why this baseline or delivery revision was recorded: Establish the required initial delivery baseline and preserve the exact integration blocker without inferring a successful delivery result.
- Next recipient/action: `/software_engineering_team/implementation_engineer` resolves the existing merge, retains both README probe contracts, executes implementation checks, updates implementation artifacts, and returns the integrated package through applicable API/E2E validation before Delivery resumes.
- Remaining blockers, rollback concerns, or untested scope: One unresolved README conflict; no integrated candidate or post-integration smoke. Upstream residuals remain unchanged: the repository-wide server TS6059 baseline, unrelated live steering assertion, no duplicated fully live Team-to-routed-frontend journey, and inapplicable Electron shell execution.


### DR-002 — Integrated current-base handoff ready for user verification

- Delivery round and trigger: Delivery resumed after implementation `IR-002` resolved DR-001 and API/E2E `API-REV-002` passed the integrated current-base candidate at 98% confidence.
- Triggering upstream report, verification, or evidence: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/codex-command-failure-detail/api-e2e-execution-coverage-report.md`; evidence commit `e28c65f00e459c89bcb0fd9b47fff5e151ddbcfe`.
- Prior authoritative result: `DR-001 Blocked — Local Fix` on one additive `autobyteus-web/README.md` integration conflict.
- Current authoritative result: `Pass — integrated/docs-synchronized handoff ready for explicit user verification`. Carried classification remains `task_size=Small`, `architectural_risk=Low`, selected route `Direct Low-Risk`.
- Docs sync report: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/codex-command-failure-detail/docs-sync-report.md` — Pass / Updated.
- Handoff summary: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/codex-command-failure-detail/handoff-summary.md` — current verification package.
- Release/publication/deployment report: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/codex-command-failure-detail/release-deployment-report.md` — finalization held; ticket-scoped release/deployment not required.
- Integration and post-integration verification: Merge `a14532534cbb618fd859d8e760f3baeafb1b01d7` contains validated candidate `005aa4f84a3315d467f949c40ff86afd9872599a` and base `ad63d74275a4eb204ebc6d97a2260aa9790fea52`. API-REV-002 validated current HEAD `e28c65f00e459c89bcb0fd9b47fff5e151ddbcfe` through 87 focused server tests, 211 passed + 10 skipped broader server tests, 59 integrated frontend tests, real Codex exit-23 execution, Chromium desktop/narrow 2/2, and prerequisite/integrity checks. A fresh Delivery fetch left the exact base unchanged and already contained, so no duplicate behavioral rerun followed documentation-only edits. Docs/handoff checks passed in `delivery-evidence/dr-002-docs-sync-and-handoff.log`.
- User verification/finalization state: Explicit user verification is pending against `handoff-summary.md`. Ticket remains in progress; no ticket-branch push, archive, final target merge/push, version/tag, release, publication, deployment, or cleanup occurred.
- Terminal return to `/requirements_engineer`: `Not yet eligible`.
- Terminal return message/reference: `N/A`.
- Why this baseline or delivery revision was recorded: Resolve the historical DR-001 blocker, synchronize canonical docs on the validated integrated state, and establish the exact user-verification hold without inferring final completion.
- Next recipient/action: User verifies/accepts the integrated handoff or reports a finding. On acceptance, Delivery refreshes `origin/personal` again and performs archival/repository finalization; on a finding, Delivery classifies and routes by origin.
- Remaining blockers, rollback concerns, or untested scope: No technical blocker. Policy hold for explicit verification. Residual scope remains the separately recorded pre-existing live steering assertion, no duplicated fully live Team-to-full-routed-frontend composition, the baseline repository TS6059 typecheck mismatch, and inapplicable Electron shell execution.


### DR-003 — Linux ARM64 Electron candidate ready for hands-on verification

- Delivery round and trigger: The user asked Delivery to read the README and build Electron so they could run the current application.
- Triggering upstream report, verification, or evidence: User request; DR-002 integrated/docs-synchronized handoff; `API-REV-002` Pass / 98%.
- Prior authoritative result: `DR-002 Pass — integrated/docs-synchronized handoff ready for explicit user verification`.
- Current authoritative result: `Pass — README-guided Linux ARM64 Electron candidate built, repository-owned artifact/startup checks passed, actual packaged Electron readiness passed, and the artifact is ready for user testing`. Carried classification remains `task_size=Small`, `architectural_risk=Low`, selected route `Direct Low-Risk`.
- Docs sync report: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/codex-command-failure-detail/docs-sync-report.md` — DR-003 re-entry check Pass / no additional long-lived doc impact.
- Handoff summary: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/codex-command-failure-detail/handoff-summary.md` — updated with artifact path, checksum, run command, and verification steps.
- Release/publication/deployment report: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/codex-command-failure-detail/release-deployment-report.md` — finalization still held; local verification build is not a release/publication/deployment.
- Integration and post-integration verification: Delivery protected DR-002 in local checkpoint `da6b96cd3fd169f192466ec8de8f2f27d21efdc0`, fetched `origin`, and confirmed unchanged `origin/personal@ad63d74275a4eb204ebc6d97a2260aa9790fea52` is already contained (`8 ahead / 0 behind`). The documented native-host command built Electron `42.4.1` enterprise version `1.4.64` for Linux ARM64. AppImage/unpacked architecture, updater metadata, bundled Prisma engines, packaged server migrations/health, actual packaged Electron Playwright readiness, owned cleanup, and final handoff-readiness checks passed. Evidence: `delivery-electron-build-dr003.log`, `delivery-electron-build-verification-dr003.log`, `delivery-electron-launch-smoke-dr003.log`, and `delivery-handoff-readiness-dr003.log`.
- User verification/finalization state: Explicit hands-on verification is pending against `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/autobyteus-web/electron-dist/AutoByteus_enterprise_linux-arm64-1.4.64.AppImage`. Ticket remains in progress; no ticket-branch push, archive, final target merge/push, version/tag, release, publication, deployment, or branch cleanup occurred.
- Terminal return to `/requirements_engineer`: `Not yet eligible`.
- Terminal return message/reference: `N/A`.
- Why this baseline or delivery revision was recorded: Preserve the exact local verification artifact, build/runtime checks, base relationship, and user-verification hold without treating a successful local package as a release or final delivery.
- Next recipient/action: User runs the Linux ARM64 AppImage, verifies/accepts the failed-command diagnostic, or reports a finding. On acceptance, Delivery refreshes `origin/personal` again and performs archival/repository finalization.
- Remaining blockers, rollback concerns, or untested scope: No technical blocker. The artifact is Linux ARM64 only and locally built, not published. Existing DR-002 residuals remain; the actual packaged Electron shell is now launch-smoke verified, while user interaction with the target behavior remains pending.


### DR-004 — Packaged Electron application running for user testing

- Delivery round and trigger: The user asked Delivery to start the built application so hands-on verification could begin.
- Triggering upstream report, verification, or evidence: User request and DR-003 Linux ARM64 verification candidate.
- Prior authoritative result: `DR-003 Pass — Linux ARM64 Electron candidate built, verified, and ready for user testing`.
- Current authoritative result: `Pass — exact unpacked packaged Electron payload is running with its ordinary embedded backend/data contract and a visible 1200x800 X11 window; ready for explicit user testing`. Carried task classification and route remain unchanged.
- Docs sync report: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/codex-command-failure-detail/docs-sync-report.md` — DR-004 operational re-entry has no long-lived documentation impact.
- Handoff summary: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/codex-command-failure-detail/handoff-summary.md` — updated with live process/health and launch limitation.
- Release/publication/deployment report: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/codex-command-failure-detail/release-deployment-report.md` — local user launch only; no release/publication/deployment.
- Integration and post-integration verification: Source/base state is unchanged from DR-003. The AppImage wrapper failed before app startup because the minimal host lacks unversioned `libz.so`. Delivery used the exact verified unpacked payload with container-required `--no-sandbox`; Electron root PID `23250` started embedded server PID `23335` on production port `29695`, used `/root/.autobyteus/server-data`, found no pending migration, reached healthy status, and exposed a visible interactive `autobyteus` window. Current readiness is recorded in `delivery-user-launch-readiness-dr004.log`.
- User verification/finalization state: Hands-on verification is now active and explicit acceptance remains pending. The app is intentionally left running. No archive, final push/merge, release, deployment, or branch cleanup occurred.
- Terminal return to `/requirements_engineer`: `Not yet eligible`.
- Terminal return message/reference: `N/A`.
- Why this delivery revision was recorded: Distinguish a successful running verification session from the failed AppImage wrapper attempt, preserve the exact host constraint, and keep finalization/cleanup truthful.
- Next recipient/action: User tests the Codex command failure detail and explicitly accepts or reports a finding. Delivery later confirms the owned app/process lifecycle before finalization.
- Remaining blockers, rollback concerns, or untested scope: No blocker to hands-on testing. The local ARM64 AppImage itself requires unversioned `libz.so` on this minimal host; portability is not claimed. The unpacked packaged payload is running with `--no-sandbox` because the verification environment is root/container-based.


### DR-005 — User-verified archived package ready for repository finalization

- Delivery round and trigger: The user stated on 2026-09-01, “the task is done. i tested it works. lets finalize the ticket. no need to release a new version”.
- Triggering upstream report, verification, or evidence: DR-004 packaged Electron session; user acceptance; `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/codex-command-failure-detail/delivery-electron-user-launch-dr004.log`.
- Prior authoritative result: `DR-004 Pass — unpacked packaged Electron payload running for hands-on verification`.
- Current authoritative result: `Pass — explicit verification accepted; Electron/backend stopped gracefully; mandatory post-acceptance target refresh is current; focused finalization validation passed; ticket artifacts are archived and ready for commit/push and target merge/push`. Carried classification remains `task_size=Small`, `architectural_risk=Low`, selected route `Direct Low-Risk`.
- Docs sync report: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/codex-command-failure-detail/docs-sync-report.md` — Pass / no additional DR-005 long-lived-doc impact.
- Handoff summary: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/codex-command-failure-detail/handoff-summary.md` — updated for accepted/archived state.
- Release/publication/deployment report: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/codex-command-failure-detail/release-deployment-report.md` — repository finalization in progress; version/tag/release/publication/deployment explicitly `Not required`.
- Integration and post-integration verification: Delivery protected prior artifacts in checkpoint `33a22161bf4606e5858eb4cb3cba45aeabd47224`, fetched `origin`, and confirmed `origin/personal` remained `ad63d74275a4eb204ebc6d97a2260aa9790fea52`, already an ancestor at `0 behind / 9 ahead`. No new base commit or user-facing delta was integrated, so renewed user verification was not required. Focused server `5 files / 87 tests`, focused frontend `2 files / 12 tests`, diff/ancestry/merge-state, README/package probe inventory, and artifact hygiene all passed. Evidence: `delivery-evidence/dr-005-finalization-refresh.log`, `dr-005-finalization-server.log`, `dr-005-finalization-web.log`, and `dr-005-finalization-validation.log`.
- User verification/finalization state: Explicit user verification complete. The owned Electron/backend process tree stopped gracefully and port `29695` closed. Ticket moved to `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/codex-command-failure-detail`. Ticket commit/push, target merge/push, and safe branch/build-output cleanup are the remaining operational steps.
- Terminal return to `/requirements_engineer`: `Not yet eligible — repository finalization and safe cleanup are still in progress`.
- Terminal return message/reference: `N/A`.
- Why this delivery revision was recorded: Preserve the explicit acceptance, no-release decision, mandatory target refresh, renewed-verification decision, final validation, process cleanup, and archive transition without prematurely claiming repository finalization.
- Next recipient/action: Delivery commits and pushes the ticket branch, refreshes and merges it into `personal`, pushes the target, performs safe cleanup, records the terminal delivery revision, and applies handoff rules.
- Remaining blockers, rollback concerns, or untested scope: No blocker. Upstream non-package residuals remain documented. Release/version/tag/deployment is intentionally not applicable.


### DR-006 — Delivery completed on `personal`

- Delivery round and trigger: Execute the remaining repository-finalization and safe-cleanup steps from the accepted, archived DR-005 package.
- Triggering upstream report, verification, or evidence: DR-005; explicit user acceptance; final ticket commit `ff09ad56132a1c4f507d479e6d3514d9348d1890`.
- Prior authoritative result: `DR-005 Pass — user-verified archived package ready for repository finalization`.
- Current authoritative result: `Delivery Completed`. Carried classification is `task_size=Small`, `architectural_risk=Low`, route `Direct Low-Risk`. Architecture design/review, source review, and test-code review remain `N/A — not applicable` under the selected route.
- Docs sync report: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/codex-command-failure-detail/docs-sync-report.md` — Pass / Updated; no new long-lived-doc impact during DR-005/DR-006 finalization.
- Handoff summary: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/codex-command-failure-detail/handoff-summary.md` — authoritative terminal completion package.
- Release/publication/deployment report: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/codex-command-failure-detail/release-deployment-report.md` — repository finalization Completed; version/tag/release/publication/deployment `Not required` by explicit user direction.
- Integration and post-integration verification: Ticket commit `ff09ad56132a1c4f507d479e6d3514d9348d1890` was pushed to `origin/req/codex-command-failure-detail`. A clean temporary worktree based on current `origin/personal@ad63d74275a4eb204ebc6d97a2260aa9790fea52` merged the ticket with `--no-ff`, producing `c226a5593f5dac0a85bd8b5a9d05074f41fedb94`, which was pushed to `origin/personal`. DR-005 executable checks remained the post-acceptance validation authority; no later source change occurred.
- User verification/finalization state: User verification complete. Ticket archived at `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/codex-command-failure-detail`. Local and remote ticket branches plus the temporary finalization worktree/branch were removed after the target push. Verification-only Electron output was removed; archived logs/checksum remain durable. Electron/backend processes are absent and port `29695` is closed.
- Terminal return to Requirements Engineer: `Eligible — apply current handoff rules after committing/pushing this final delivery record`.
- Terminal return message/reference: `Pending handoff dispatch after this record is durable`.
- Why this delivery revision was recorded: Establish the authoritative completed delivery result with exact repository integration, no-release outcome, and safe cleanup evidence.
- Next recipient/action: Requirements Engineer verifies this cumulative terminal package and returns the department result under parent cross-team routing rules.
- Remaining blockers, rollback concerns, or untested scope: No delivery blocker. No release rollback exists because no version/tag/release/publication/deployment was performed. The upstream pre-existing live steering assertion and documented non-duplicated composition remain separate residuals, not package failures.
