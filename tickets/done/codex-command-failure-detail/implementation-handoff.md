## Current Implementation Summary

The Codex payload parser now enriches only provider-failed `commandExecution` errors. Direct provider `error`/`message` and existing parsed error evidence retain precedence. Otherwise, non-blank combined `aggregatedOutput` is returned with a usable non-zero exit code on a separate readable line, an exit-code-only message is used when output is absent, and `Tool execution failed.` remains the no-detail fallback. Successful, denied, interrupted, and non-command families remain on their existing paths.

The existing canonical failure string continues through standalone/team streaming and local trace persistence. Diagnostic `thread/read` projection also receives the enriched command-only string through the same parser. The center tool card now preserves multiline error whitespace, matching the existing Activity error presentation.

For `IR-002`, the previously validated candidate was integrated with the latest fetched base `origin/personal@ad63d74275a4eb204ebc6d97a2260aa9790fea52` in merge commit `a14532534cbb618fd859d8e760f3baeafb1b01d7`. The sole conflict in `autobyteus-web/README.md` was resolved additively: both the Codex command-failure browser probe and incoming task-agent monitor browser probe remain documented, both package scripts remain present, and the shared port/Chromium discovery note appears once. Both `005aa4f84a3315d467f949c40ff86afd9872599a` and the fetched base are confirmed ancestors; no unmerged path or active merge state remains. No production behavior was changed by this integration correction.

## Routing Classification (Mandatory)

- Task size (`Small`/`Medium`/`Large`): `Small`
- Architecture risk (`Low`/`High`): `Low`
- Requirements routing assessment path: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/codex-command-failure-detail/requirements-doc.md` (`Architecture Design Routing Assessment`)
- Classification confirmed or changed: `Confirmed`
- Evidence and rationale for confirmation or change: The completed product delta remains a bounded command-family content projection plus one existing-card whitespace class. `IR-002` only resolves an additive README merge conflict against the current base and retains both existing probe contracts. It changes no public event shape, persistence schema, lifecycle, ownership boundary, concurrency, security/privacy policy, deployment topology, migration behavior, or production source. The only ticket production source change remains under the 500-effective-line guardrail and the source delta is below the 220-line pressure threshold.
- Selected route (`Direct API/E2E`/`Code Review`/`Architecture Designer`): `Direct API/E2E — the current team-config has no Code Reviewer rule for confirmed Small/Low work; the user's explicit source-review request is recorded for downstream visibility without falsifying the classification`
- Lightweight implementation self-review completed for the direct route: `Yes`
- New design impact or escalation trigger: `None`

## Reviewed Behavior Implementation Trace

| Behavior ID | Approved Change / Preserved Outcome | Implemented Production Path / Key Files | Result / Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BEH-001 | Failed Codex `run_bash` exposes actionable provider evidence while remaining failed and preserving command/cwd/turn/invocation facts. | `autobyteus-server-ts/src/agent-execution/backends/codex/items/codex-tool-payload-parser.ts` -> existing terminal event converter; provider-shaped converter coverage in `autobyteus-server-ts/tests/unit/agent-execution/backends/codex/events/codex-thread-event-converter.test.ts`. | Output-plus-exit, exit-only, and generic fallback are command-failure-only; event classification and correlation fields remain unchanged. |
| BEH-002 | Standalone/team UI and newly recorded replay use the same enriched error; existing layouts remain. | Existing standalone/team mappers and `runtime-tool-trace-sequencer.ts` continue forwarding/persisting `error`; diagnostic history uses the shared parser. `autobyteus-web/components/conversation/ToolCallIndicator.vue` now matches `ToolActivityItem.vue` multiline preservation. | No alternate UI-only or persistence field introduced. Historical generic traces are not backfilled. |
| BEH-003 | Explicit provider detail wins; nullable command fields safely reach output+exit, exit-only, or generic fallback. | Command-gated resolution and matrix tests in `codex-tool-payload-parser.ts` and `codex-item-event-payload-parser.test.ts`. | Blank strings and `exitCode: 0` do not become a failure cause. Non-command families retain the existing generic resolver behavior. |

## Important Assumptions

- Codex `aggregatedOutput` is intentionally presented as combined command diagnostic text; no stdout/stderr distinction is inferred.
- A usable exit code is an integer other than zero. A zero code on a provider-failed item is not displayed as the failure cause.
- Existing standalone/team/frontend/replay consumers remain authoritative for the canonical failed-event `error` string.

## Known Risks

- `API-REV-001` passed the pre-integration standalone/team/live/replay/browser package at 98%; the merged current-base candidate still requires the configured API/E2E revalidation gate before Delivery resumes.
- Codex App Server's experimental payload can evolve; absent or invalid diagnostic fields intentionally retain a safe generic error.
- The user explicitly requested source code review after implementation. Current dynamic handoff rules route confirmed Small/Low work directly to API/E2E and expose Code Reviewer only for Large/High work, so this implementation stage cannot select Code Reviewer without misclassifying the result.

## Task Design Health Assessment Implementation Check

- Reviewed change posture: `Behavior correction`
- Reviewed root-cause classification: `Codex provider-payload projection gap at the existing parser/converter boundary`
- Reviewed refactor decision (`Refactor Needed Now`/`No Refactor Needed`/`Deferred`): `No Refactor Needed`
- Implementation matched the reviewed assessment (`Yes`/`No`): `Yes`
- If challenged, routed as `Design Impact` (`Yes`/`No`/`N/A`): `N/A`
- Evidence / notes: Existing authoritative failure and UI boundaries support the requirement. The parser branch is explicitly gated to failed `commandExecution` items, and no new boundary or return contract was introduced.

## Legacy / Compatibility Removal Check

- Backward-compatibility mechanisms introduced: `None`
- Legacy old-behavior retained in scope: `No`
- Dead/obsolete code, obsolete files, unused helpers/tests/flags/adapters, and dormant replaced paths removed in scope: `Yes — no separate superseded path remained after the in-place correction`
- Shared structures remain tight (no one-for-all base or overlapping parallel shapes introduced): `Yes`
- Canonical shared design guidance was reapplied during implementation, and file-level design weaknesses were routed upstream when needed: `Yes`
- Changed source implementation files stayed within proactive size-pressure guardrails (`>500` avoided; `>220` assessed/acted on): `Yes`
- Notes: `codex-tool-payload-parser.ts` is 494 effective non-empty lines after the change; source deltas are below 220 changed lines. Test files are outside the source hard limit.

## Persisted Data Transition Check (When Applicable)

- Approved decision (`Not Affected`/`Directly Usable — No Migration`/`Discard or Rebuild`/`Migration Required`): `Directly Usable — No Migration`
- Design-spec decision reference: `N/A — direct route`; see `Data Continuity And Acceptable Loss` in the approved requirements.
- Implementation follows the approved decision without an unapproved migration or version-specific runtime fallback: `Yes`
- Direct-use evidence or discard/rebuild result, when applicable: The existing trace writer already persists the failed-event error string. Future rows contain the enriched string; current readers accept it unchanged. Older generic strings remain valid and are not rewritten.
- Migration implementation and focused checks, only when `Migration Required`: `N/A`
- Deviation from the reviewed transition decision: `None`

## Environment Or Dependency Notes

- Dependencies were installed from the frozen workspace lockfile for the server and web packages.
- `pnpm -C autobyteus-server-ts typecheck` remains unusable because the repository `tsconfig.json` sets `rootDir: src` while also including `tests`, producing baseline `TS6059` errors across the test tree. The build configuration source check passed after the normal Prisma client generation.
- The web component tests require `pnpm -C autobyteus-web exec nuxt prepare` in a clean checkout to generate `.nuxt/tsconfig.json`.

## Local Implementation Checks Run

- `git diff --check` — passed.
- `pnpm -C autobyteus-server-ts exec prisma generate --schema ./prisma/schema.prisma` — passed.
- `pnpm -C autobyteus-server-ts exec tsc -p tsconfig.build.json --noEmit` — passed.
- Focused provider/parser/converter/history tests: 4 files, 85 tests — passed.
- Broader implementation-scoped Codex, stream mapper, trace sequencer, and run projection unit suite: 20 files, 274 tests — passed.
- Frontend component/handler suite for center card, Activity item, and failure handler: 3 files, 24 tests — passed after `nuxt prepare`.
- `pnpm -C autobyteus-server-ts typecheck` — not passed due the baseline `TS6059` repository configuration issue described above; no errors from the changed source were present in the passing build-config source check.
- `IR-002` integrated focused provider/parser/converter/history suite: 4 files, 85 tests — passed.
- `IR-002` package-script browser execution: `pnpm -C autobyteus-web test:e2e:codex-command-failure-detail -- --browser-executable /usr/bin/chromium --output-dir ../tickets/done/codex-command-failure-detail/probes/implementation-ir-002/browser` — passed at desktop and 390px with owned fixture/process cleanup.
- `IR-002` executable README/package consistency assertion — passed; both probe sections, both package scripts, both executable target files, one shared browser-discovery note, and no conflict markers were confirmed. Evidence: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/codex-command-failure-detail/probes/implementation-ir-002/readme-package-consistency.log`.
- `IR-002` integration verification — passed; merge commit `a14532534cbb618fd859d8e760f3baeafb1b01d7` has validated candidate `005aa4f84a3315d467f949c40ff86afd9872599a` and latest base `ad63d74275a4eb204ebc6d97a2260aa9790fea52` as parents/ancestors, with no unmerged path or active merge. Evidence: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/codex-command-failure-detail/probes/implementation-ir-002/integration-verification.log`.

## Frontend Rendered-Result Check (When Applicable)

- Affected surfaces / journeys: Existing failed center tool card and Activity error section for live or replayed standalone/team runs.
- Approved UI/UX, interaction, requirement, or design references: Approved requirements REQ-003/REQ-006 and AC-002/AC-003/AC-009; user screenshot `/home/autobyteus/data/memory/agent_teams/software_development_department_b40dd773428c4a3fa3643158732e996b/requirements_engineer_01fcde30983a42f6983f16280a00c327/context_files/ctx_efd9a119e8ba__image.png`.
- Existing design system, shared components, and adjacent product surfaces reviewed: `ToolCallIndicator.vue`, `ToolActivityItem.vue`, `toolLifecycleHandler.ts`, and their focused tests.
- Project development / preview instructions and rendered surface used: Integrated `autobyteus-web/README.md`; project-owned self-starting Nuxt/Chromium probe invoked through the integrated `autobyteus-web/package.json` script.
- States, layouts, viewports, and interactions inspected: Failed center-card and Activity diagnostic at 1280px and 390px. Exact multiline marker/exit-code text, computed whitespace preservation, and absence of narrow document overflow were asserted; resulting screenshots were visually inspected.
- Visual or interaction issues found and corrected: The Activity card already used `whitespace-pre-wrap`; the center tool card did not. Added the same whitespace-preserving behavior without changing layout or interaction.
- Supporting evidence and remaining unverified states or limitations: Integrated browser evidence passed and is retained at `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/codex-command-failure-detail/probes/implementation-ir-002/browser/evidence.json`, with desktop/narrow screenshots alongside it. The probe is a deterministic renderer fixture; current-base transport/live/replay revalidation remains downstream API/E2E responsibility.

## Downstream Coverage Hints / Suggested Scenarios

- Replay the retained `status: failed`, `aggregatedOutput: CODEX_FAILURE_STDERR_MARKER`, `exitCode: 23` shape and assert failed classification, both visible facts, command/cwd, invocation, and turn correlation.
- Exercise explicit `error` and `message` precedence over aggregated output.
- Exercise multiline output with and without a non-zero exit code; output absent/blank with non-zero exit; no useful details; and `exitCode: 0`.
- Verify non-command Codex families, command success/denial/interruption, and overall turn continuation are unchanged.
- Verify identical standalone and team stream payloads reach both existing UI surfaces.
- Record and reopen a new failed run through normal local replay and compare the persisted/replayed diagnostic.

## API / E2E / Executable Coverage Investigation And Execution Still Required

Required for `IR-002`. API/E2E Engineer owns revalidation of the integrated current-base candidate and the next pass/fail classification before Delivery resumes.
