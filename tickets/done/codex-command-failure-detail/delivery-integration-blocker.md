# Delivery Integration Blocker

## DR-002 Resolution

- Status: `Resolved`
- Resolution owner/result: Implementation `IR-002` completed merge `a14532534cbb618fd859d8e760f3baeafb1b01d7`; API/E2E `API-REV-002` passed the integrated candidate at 98% confidence in evidence commit `e28c65f00e459c89bcb0fd9b47fff5e151ddbcfe`.
- Exact resolution: `autobyteus-web/README.md` and `package.json` retain both the Codex command-failure and task-agent-monitor probe documentation/scripts/targets with one shared browser-discovery note; no unmerged path or conflict marker remains.
- Current delivery state: `DR-002 — Pass; ready for explicit user verification`.
- Historical value: the remainder of this artifact preserves the exact DR-001 blocker and must not be treated as a current blocker.

## Historical DR-001 Record

- Delivery revision: `DR-001`
- Result: `Blocked`
- Classification: `Local Fix`
- Recommended recipient: `/software_engineering_team/implementation_engineer`
- Package: `REQ-CODEX-COMMAND-FAILURE-DETAIL-20260901`
- Carried classification: `task_size=Small`; `architectural_risk=Low`; route `Direct Low-Risk`
- Ticket branch: `req/codex-command-failure-detail`
- Workspace: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace`

## Protected Validated State

- Bootstrap base: `80e2bd195c42ea3ced778dbc051d4d00edaef16f`
- Validated API/E2E candidate: `005aa4f84a3315d467f949c40ff86afd9872599a` (`API-REV-001`, 98% confidence), following implementation commit `190f5bee1b6ed624bba1d0247da1b4225abf125a` (`IR-001`)
- Latest fetched target: `origin/personal@ad63d74275a4eb204ebc6d97a2260aa9790fea52`
- Incoming base advance: 8 commits after bootstrap, including release `v1.4.64` and task-agent monitor visibility
- Checkpoint: `Not needed` — the validated candidate and all upstream artifacts were already committed and the worktree was clean
- Integration command: `git merge --no-edit origin/personal`
- Current merge state: in progress; `HEAD` remains the validated candidate and `MERGE_HEAD` is the latest fetched target

## Unresolved Path

| Path | Boundary | Conflict | Required Combined Truth |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `autobyteus-web/README.md` | Long-lived web test/runbook documentation | Both the validated ticket and latest base inserted a browser-probe section and an available-script entry at the same anchors. | Retain the Codex command failure detail probe section/script **and** the incoming task-agent monitor visibility probe section/script without duplicating the shared Chromium discovery note. |

The conflict is additive and does not itself establish architectural impact or a requirement gap. Delivery nevertheless did not resolve or stage it because the delivery workflow requires a conflicted latest-base refresh to stop and be routed before docs synchronization. Automatically merged base changes remain in the merge worktree for the implementation owner to inspect.

## Required Rework And Gates

1. Resolve `autobyteus-web/README.md` against the full current base, retaining both documented probes and both package scripts.
2. Complete the existing merge rather than discarding either feature's current behavior.
3. Confirm the integrated tree has no unmerged paths and that `origin/personal@ad63d74275a4eb204ebc6d97a2260aa9790fea52` is an ancestor of the resulting ticket state.
4. Run at least one focused executable check for the Codex failure-detail path on the integrated state; include the frontend package-script/README consistency check because those are the overlapping paths.
5. Update the implementation handoff and implementation revision record for the integration correction, then route the corrected integrated package through the applicable API/E2E validation gate before returning to Delivery. Architecture and independent source-review artifacts remain `N/A — not applicable` unless the correction reveals actual structural impact or changes the carried classification.

## Delivery Work Held

- Post-integration executable validation: `Held` — no integrated candidate exists.
- Long-lived docs sync: `Held` — the README intended as part of the validated coverage documentation is unresolved, and server Codex runtime docs were not edited against a conflicted tree.
- `handoff-summary.md`: `Not created` — the mandatory integrated and checked handoff state does not yet exist.
- User verification request: `Not issued`.
- Ticket archival, branch push, target merge/push, release/publication/deployment, and cleanup: `Not started`.
