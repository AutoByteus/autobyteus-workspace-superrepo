- Current requirements revision ID: `RER-002`
- Investigation status: Complete; requirements approved and classified `Approved Direct-Implementation`.

## Initial Request And Clarifications

- Original request: Investigate why a Bash failure from an agent using the Codex runtime appears in AutoByteus only as `Tool execution failed.` Determine whether Codex, the converter, or an AutoByteus mapping is responsible. Probe Codex App Server with a failing command and inspect the returned data.
- Clarifications received: The user asked whether the Codex command payload could be mapped to the AutoByteus `run_bash` return, then explicitly approved the current requirements package and requested routing, noting that the technical mapping choice is downstream responsibility. The question is retained as implementation context, not as an approved structural return-contract change.
- User-supplied facts and constraints: Screenshot shows a running Codex team member (`implementation_engineer`) with a failed `run_bash` Activity card whose Error section contains only `Tool execution failed.` The user explicitly requested an experiment rather than an assumption.
- Initial ambiguity: Whether Codex App Server omitted diagnostic data, the backend converter discarded it, or the frontend failed to render it.

## Product And Domain Understanding

- Product area: Agent runtime execution lifecycle; Codex App Server integration; agent Activity and conversation tool-card diagnostics; local replay.
- Affected actors or systems: Users monitoring agent runs, standalone and team-member Codex runs, AutoByteus backend event conversion/streaming, frontend tool lifecycle projection.
- Existing user or operational purpose: Failed tool cards let a user understand why an agent action failed without inspecting raw provider events or server logs.
- Relevant terminology:
  - `commandExecution`: Codex App Server thread item for a sandboxed shell command.
  - `run_bash`: AutoByteus canonical tool name for Codex command execution.
  - `aggregatedOutput`: Codex's combined terminal command output in the completed item.
  - `exitCode`: Provider-reported process exit status.
  - `TOOL_EXECUTION_FAILED`: Canonical AutoByteus lifecycle event consumed by live UI and local memory recording.

## Source Log

| Date | Source Type (`Code`/`Doc`/`Runtime`/`Data`/`Contract`/`Web`/`User`/`Command`/`Other`) | Exact Source / Command / Query | Why Consulted | Relevant Finding | Follow-Up |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-09-01 | User | User request and screenshot `ctx_efd9a119e8ba__image.png` | Establish the supported symptom and affected surface. | A failed Codex team-member `run_bash` card displays only `Tool execution failed.` in Activity. | Trace the failure event from provider to UI. |
| 2026-09-01 | Command | `codex --version` | Pin the local provider used for the requested probe. | `codex-cli 0.152.0`. | Generate/probe its current protocol. |
| 2026-09-01 | Runtime | `python3 tickets/done/codex-command-failure-detail/probe-codex-failed-command.py` | Execute the user-requested live App Server experiment. | Provider terminal item contained `status: failed`, `aggregatedOutput: "CODEX_FAILURE_STDERR_MARKER"`, and `exitCode: 23`; the turn itself completed. | Compare with converter extraction. |
| 2026-09-01 | Data | `codex-app-server-failed-command-raw.jsonl` | Retain provider evidence. | The failure detail exists before AutoByteus conversion. | Use exact shape in acceptance criteria. |
| 2026-09-01 | Command / Contract | `codex app-server generate-ts --out /tmp/codex-protocol-FJkEAT` | Confirm locally generated protocol fields. | `ThreadItem` command variant defines nullable `aggregatedOutput` and `exitCode`, plus status. | Require nullable-field handling. |
| 2026-09-01 | Web / Contract | Official Codex App Server README, <https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/main/codex-rs/app-server/README.md> | Corroborate current provider contract using a primary source. | Official docs state final command items include output, exit code, and duration so clients can summarize execution and success/failure. | Treat provider fields as supported contract evidence. |
| 2026-09-01 | Code | `autobyteus-server-ts/src/agent-execution/backends/codex/items/codex-tool-payload-parser.ts` | Identify extraction behavior. | `resolveToolResult` reads `aggregatedOutput`; `resolveToolError` does not read `aggregatedOutput` or `exitCode`, then returns the generic fallback. | Define command-specific desired precedence. |
| 2026-09-01 | Code | `autobyteus-server-ts/src/agent-execution/backends/codex/events/codex-terminal-tool-execution-event.ts` and `codex-item-event-converter.ts` | Trace terminal mapping. | Failed command item becomes `TOOL_EXECUTION_FAILED`; failure path publishes `error` and does not publish result as the canonical failure fact. | The error mapping must retain useful command diagnostics. |
| 2026-09-01 | Code | `team-agent-event-adapter.ts`, `team-agent-event-websocket-projector.ts`, `agent-run-event-message-mapper.ts` | Check standalone/team loss boundaries. | Streaming layers preserve the normalized failure `error`; team adapter contract carries the same required string. | Root cause precedes these layers. |
| 2026-09-01 | Code | Frontend `toolLifecycleHandler.ts`, `ToolActivityItem.vue`, `ToolCallIndicator.vue` | Determine whether frontend ignores richer data. | Frontend stores and renders the failed event's `error` unchanged in both existing surfaces. | No frontend redesign needed. |
| 2026-09-01 | Code | `runtime-tool-trace-sequencer.ts` and Codex integration docs | Check replay consequence. | Failed event error is persisted as `tool_error`; normal run history uses local replay. Generic live mapping therefore becomes generic replay too. | Include newly recorded replay consistency; no backfill. |
| 2026-09-01 | Code / Test | `codex-run-view-projection-provider.test.ts` failed-command fixture | Assess existing coverage. | A diagnostic/native history fixture currently expects rich result `{output, exit_code}` but generic `toolError`, demonstrating the diagnostic split; normal UI uses local replay, not this provider projection. | Add focused live-converter/replay coverage rather than relying on native history. |
| 2026-09-01 | Code | `autobyteus-ts/src/tools/terminal/types.ts`, `run-bash.ts`, and `shell-command-executor.ts` | Evaluate the user's question about mapping to the AutoByteus `run_bash` return. | Native AutoByteus returns `TerminalResult { stdout, stderr, exitCode, timedOut, effectiveCwd, backgroundProcesses }`; non-zero exit is returned as a structured result. The observed Codex item supplies combined `aggregatedOutput`, `exitCode`, and `cwd`, not separated stdout/stderr or the full native shape. | Downstream may reuse compatible mapping concepts but must not fabricate missing semantics or change the approved failed-event contract without escalation. |
| 2026-09-01 | User | “anyways, i approved. you can route now.” | Capture explicit approval and routing authorization. | REQ-001-REQ-006, AC-001-AC-009, and SCN-001-SCN-003 are approved. The earlier return-mapping question does not block routing. | Complete routing assessment and dynamic handoff. |

## Relevant Existing Behavior And Supported Product Paths

| Behavior ID | Kind | Supported Trigger Or Governing Contract | Current Supported Product Behavior Path / Lifecycle | Current Outcome / Invariants | Evidence | Confidence / Unknown |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BEH-001 | System | Codex agent invokes the supported command tool during an ordinary standalone or team-member turn. | Codex App Server executes command -> terminal `item/completed(commandExecution)` reports failed status/output/exit code -> Codex converter emits `TOOL_EXECUTION_FAILED(run_bash)` -> stream adapter forwards it. | Failure status, command/cwd, invocation identity, and turn continuation are preserved; useful failure detail is replaced by generic fallback. | Live probe; converter/parser sources. | High confidence. |
| BEH-002 | User | User views the existing live Activity or center tool card, or reopens the run through normal local replay. | Frontend handler applies failed event -> Activity and tool card render `error`; memory sequencer persists the same `error` for replay. | UI faithfully shows `Tool execution failed.` because that is what backend supplied. | Screenshot; frontend and memory sources. | High confidence. |
| BEH-003 | Contract | App Server terminal command item may have nullable output/exit-code fields. | Converter evaluates explicit error/message and selected result/content/output fields; if none match, it uses `Tool execution failed.` | Generic fallback is valid only for truly detail-free failures, but currently also covers command output/exit-code cases. | Generated 0.152.0 types; official README; parser source. | High confidence. |

No technically possible but unsupported/contrived path was promoted into scope.
The direct live App Server experiment is diagnostic evidence for the supported
agent-command scenario, not a new user journey.

## Relevant Codebase And Technical Facts

| Path / Component / Contract | Current Responsibility Or Behavior | Requirement Implication | Architecture Question Deferred Downstream |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `.../codex/items/codex-tool-payload-parser.ts:258-316` | Reads `aggregatedOutput` for results but not errors; generic fallback at line 316. | Failed command error must consume supported command-specific failure evidence. | Which existing extraction owner should format the command-specific diagnostic without affecting other tool families? |
| `.../codex/events/codex-terminal-tool-execution-event.ts:75-109` | Selects failed/succeeded event and publishes `error` on failure. | No new visible event type is required; enriched error must fit the existing failure contract. | Exact internal placement remains downstream. |
| `.../codex/events/codex-item-event-converter.ts:323-336` | Maps `commandExecution` completion to the shared terminal event helper. | The correction must cover the normal live command path. | None beyond safe ownership. |
| `.../agent-team-execution/services/team-agent-event-adapter.ts:330-331` | Requires a failure error string for team events. | Enrichment must occur before or at normalized failure creation, not rely on a missing team result field. | Preserve the established team contract unless implementation evidence forces a requirement gap. |
| `.../services/agent-streaming/agent-run-event-message-mapper.ts:115-116` | Passes standalone failed payload to WebSocket. | Standalone path should automatically receive the enriched error. | None. |
| `autobyteus-web/services/agentStreaming/handlers/toolLifecycleHandler.ts:404-437` | Stores parsed failure error on segment and Activity. | Existing frontend behavior is sufficient. | Frontend code change is not required by product behavior unless validation finds a separate defect. |
| `autobyteus-web/components/progress/ToolActivityItem.vue:97-113` | Renders Activity `error` with whitespace-preserving styling. | Multiline diagnostic can be shown in the current layout. | None. |
| `autobyteus-web/components/conversation/ToolCallIndicator.vue:63-66` | Renders center tool-card error message. | Same canonical error should appear there. | None. |
| `.../agent-memory/services/runtime-tool-trace-sequencer.ts:135-157` | Persists failed event error in local tool-result trace. | Newly recorded failures should replay the enriched error; no schema migration is implied. | Confirm existing replay reads the string without transformation. |

## Structural And Payload Surface Inventory

### Payload Or Content Surfaces

- Files, records, documents, catalogs, fixtures, or generated payloads:
  - Codex `commandExecution` terminal item: `status`, `aggregatedOutput`, `exitCode`, command/cwd/identity facts.
  - Normalized `TOOL_EXECUTION_FAILED.error` string.
  - Local raw trace `tool_error` string for newly recorded failures.
- Existing readers, writers, or contracts that consume them:
  - Codex payload parser/converter writes normalized failure.
  - Standalone and team stream layers consume and forward `error`.
  - Frontend tool handler/cards consume it.
  - Memory sequencer persists it; local replay consumes it.
- Evidence paths: Source files listed above; live raw JSONL; probe summary.

### Structural Surfaces

- Runtime modules, shared interfaces, routes, APIs, persistence boundaries, security/concurrency controls, deployment configuration, or ownership boundaries:
  - Codex item conversion boundary.
  - Existing failed-tool domain/WebSocket/team-stream contract.
  - Existing local raw-trace persistence and replay.
- Existing structural surfaces that can support the approved behavior:
  - All downstream surfaces already accept and display a detailed non-empty error string.
- Evidence paths: Converter/helper, stream adapters, frontend handler/components, memory sequencer.

### Potential Architecture-Design Triggers

- API or external-contract change: No product requirement for a shape change; current `error` string is sufficient.
- Persistence schema or invariant change: No schema change required; only new string content for future records.
- Security or privacy boundary change: None identified; existing command diagnostic output is already an execution result/log surface.
- Concurrency or lifecycle change: None; failed state and turn continuation are preserved.
- Deployment, migration, ownership-boundary, architectural-pattern, or structural-refactoring change: None currently identified. A shared-parser change needs bounded regression care but does not itself establish structural impact.
- Confirmed absent, present, or unknown: Absent for the approved bounded mapping correction. Exact native `TerminalResult` contract parity is not part of the approved scope and would require downstream escalation if proposed as structural behavior.

## Runtime, Probe, Or Reproduction Findings

| Method / Command | Scenario | Observation | Requirement Implication | Artifact / Evidence Path |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Live stdio App Server probe via `probe-codex-failed-command.py` | SCN-001 | Exact failing command ran once; terminal item had marker in `aggregatedOutput`, `exitCode: 23`, and `status: failed`; turn completed. | Provider supplies sufficient actionable evidence; command failure does not imply failed turn. | `codex-app-server-failed-command-raw.jsonl`; `codex-command-failure-probe.md` |
| `codex app-server generate-ts --out /tmp/codex-protocol-FJkEAT` | SCN-003 | Current local type marks output and exit code nullable. | Mapping needs output+exit, exit-only, and no-detail fallback cases. | Generated temporary protocol; summarized in probe markdown. |
| Static production-path inspection | SCN-001, SCN-002 | Error detail is lost in Codex error extraction and stays unchanged through stream, UI, and memory. | Focus requirements on command-failure mapping, not Codex or frontend redesign. | Exact source paths and line ranges in Source Log. |

## Stakeholder And User Evidence

| Source / Actor | Need, Problem, Or Constraint | Evidence Strength | Requirement Implication | Open Question |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| User request | Wants to know whether Codex, converter, or AutoByteus mapping causes generic failure and wants actual error visible. | Direct, high. | Investigate live provider and define actionable error behavior. | Await approval of detailed precedence and replay consistency. |
| User screenshot | Team-member Activity Error contains only `Tool execution failed.` | Direct visual evidence, high. | Team stream and existing Activity surface are explicitly in scope. | None. |

## External Contracts, Standards, And Dependencies

| Contract / Dependency | Version / Authority | Relevant Behavior Or Constraint | Evidence | Unknown / Risk |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Codex App Server thread item protocol | Local official CLI 0.152.0; OpenAI Codex repository README | Failed command terminal item uses status plus nullable combined output and exit code; no separate command `error` field is required by the item shape. | Generated TS; official README. | Experimental protocol can evolve; absent fields need a safe fallback. |
| AutoByteus failed tool event | Current repository at base revision | Failure contract carries required error text through standalone/team paths. | Server adapter/projector sources and frontend parser. | Broad contract changes would be unnecessary scope expansion based on current evidence. |

## Persisted Data And State Facts

- Affected stored or external subject: Newly appended local raw-trace tool-result error for a failed Codex command.
- Location and representative shape: Per-run memory `raw_traces.jsonl`; `trace_type: tool_result`, canonical tool identity, `tool_error` string.
- Approximate volume: One string field per newly observed failed command; no bulk existing-data operation.
- Current readers and writers: `RuntimeToolTraceSequencer` writes; local replay projection reads.
- Current unknown/extra-field behavior: Not applicable; no new field is required.
- Required semantics or data that must be preserved: Invocation/turn/tool identity, ordering, failed status, and existing trace readability.
- Acceptable loss, reset, rebuild, or regeneration: Existing historical generic errors may remain generic; no backfill.
- Privacy, retention, compliance, downtime, or operational constraints: Existing command-output retention/presentation policy is preserved; no downtime.
- Remaining evidence gap: None material for desired behavior.

## Assumptions, Unknowns, And Risks

| ID | Type (`Assumption`/`Unknown`/`Risk`) | Description | Why It Matters | Resolution / Owner | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ASM-001 | Assumption | Existing canonical failure `error` string is the right visible carrier. | Avoids needless contract/UI changes. | Source-validated and user-approved; Implementation Engineer rechecks tests. | Validated |
| RSK-001 | Risk | `CodexToolPayloadParser` is shared across tool families. A broad extraction change could alter unrelated errors. | Scope is command failure only. | Preserve REQ-005/AC-008; downstream implementation/review. | Open downstream risk |
| RSK-002 | Risk | `aggregatedOutput` is combined stdout/stderr and may contain ordinary output as well as error text. | UI must call it diagnostic output, not claim stream provenance. | Requirements prohibit fabricated stdout/stderr distinction. | Mitigated in scope |
| UNK-001 | Unknown | Exact formatting chosen for output plus exit code. | Punctuation is not product-critical if both facts are visible and precedence holds. | Downstream within approved REQ-002/REQ-006. | Non-blocking |

## Requirement Implications

- The live probe resolves the initial ambiguity: Codex supplies the diagnostics;
  AutoByteus drops them while resolving the failed command error.
- The intended correction is payload/content mapping on an existing supported
  failure scenario, not a change to command execution, turn lifecycle, or UI
  structure.
- Explicit provider errors must remain authoritative. Command output and exit
  code fill the current command-specific gap; a generic fallback remains
  necessary for a detail-free failure.
- Because the same normalized error feeds standalone/team live UI and local
  replay persistence, the requirements cover consistency across those existing
  surfaces without requiring a historical migration.

## Notes For Downstream Architecture Design Or Direct Implementation

- Approved scenario basis, once approved: SCN-001 through SCN-003.
- Preserve the provider fact that a command item may fail while the Codex turn
  completes normally.
- Recheck the shared parser boundary so command-specific evidence does not
  modify MCP/dynamic/web-search/file-change error semantics.
- Verify standalone, team-member, memory, and replay consumers using the
  existing failure error string; do not introduce an alternate UI-only source.
- Use the retained provider-shaped sample as executable fixture evidence.
- The user's AutoByteus-return question is useful implementation context:
  native `TerminalResult` separates stdout/stderr and includes fields the Codex
  item does not expose. Reuse compatible mapping or presentation logic only
  where semantically accurate. Do not invent stream separation, turn a
  provider-failed command into success, or widen the public contract under this
  direct route.
- Exact target code structure and final architecture-risk classification remain
  downstream responsibilities.
