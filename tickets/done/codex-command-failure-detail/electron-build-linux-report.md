# Electron Build Report — Linux ARM64 Verification Candidate

## Request And Documented Method

- User request: read the repository instructions and build Electron so the current application can be run for hands-on verification.
- Instructions reviewed:
  - `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/README.md`
  - `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/autobyteus-web/README.md`
  - `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/.github/workflows/release-desktop.yml` for the repository-owned Linux ARM64 artifact checks
- Host: Linux `aarch64`; Node `v22.23.1`; pnpm `10.28.2`.
- Selected documented build: `pnpm -C autobyteus-web build:electron:linux:arm64`.
- Build flavor/version reported by the repository build: `enterprise`, version `1.4.64`, Electron `42.4.1`.

## Integrated Source And Base Safety

- Ticket branch: `req/codex-command-failure-detail`
- API/E2E validated state: `e28c65f00e459c89bcb0fd9b47fff5e151ddbcfe` (`API-REV-002`, Pass / 98%)
- Delivery verification-handoff checkpoint: `da6b96cd3fd169f192466ec8de8f2f27d21efdc0`
- Latest target fetch before build: `origin/personal@ad63d74275a4eb204ebc6d97a2260aa9790fea52`
- Relationship: target already contained; checkpoint was `8 ahead / 0 behind`; no new merge or renewed verification was required before the build.
- The checkpoint is a local pre-verification safety commit, not repository finalization or publication.

## Verification Result

All checks passed:

1. AppImage and unpacked runtime are executable Linux ARM64/aarch64 ELF files.
2. `latest-linux-arm64.yml` references the exact ARM64 AppImage and contains the required embedded `blockMapSize` metadata.
3. Bundled Prisma schema/query engines for `linux-arm64-openssl-3.0.x` are present in both engine and client locations.
4. The unpacked packaged Electron runtime started the bundled server as Electron-run-as-Node, applied all 24 migrations to an isolated temporary SQLite database, reached `/rest/health`, and shut down cleanly.
5. A real packaged Electron Playwright launch reached ready state using the built unpacked executable on an isolated port/data root, then cleaned its owned root and stopped responding on its owned port.
6. Build-created shared SDK `dist/` directories that were absent before the build were removed; the AppImage and unpacked package remained available through user testing and were removed after acceptance during DR-006 cleanup.

Evidence:

- `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/codex-command-failure-detail/delivery-electron-build-verification-dr003.log`
- `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/codex-command-failure-detail/delivery-electron-launch-smoke-dr003.log`
- `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/codex-command-failure-detail/delivery-handoff-readiness-dr003.log`

Non-blocking build warnings were limited to the repository's existing Browserslist-age, module-type, workspace-bin/peer-dependency, deprecated-subdependency, and large-chunk notices. All guards, builds, packaging, architecture/metadata checks, server startup, migrations, Electron readiness, and cleanup completed with exit `0`.

## How To Run The Verification Candidate

On this Linux ARM64 host, run:

```bash
/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/autobyteus-web/electron-dist/AutoByteus_enterprise_linux-arm64-1.4.64.AppImage
```

At DR-003 handoff time, the artifact was executable. A normal launch uses the packaged production contract: bundled backend on `http://127.0.0.1:29695` and ordinary Linux data under `~/.autobyteus/server-data`. The automated launch smoke used an isolated temporary profile and removed it; it did not modify ordinary production data. The verification-only build output was removed after user acceptance and repository finalization; rebuild with the documented command if another local artifact is needed.

This local artifact is for Linux ARM64 only and is not a published release. A macOS, Windows, or Linux x64 artifact requires that matching native host/runner under the README contract.

## Historical User Verification Target

After launch, run a Codex-backed Agent or Team member through the exact failure scenario and confirm both the center tool card and Activity panel display:

```text
CODEX_FAILURE_STDERR_MARKER
Exit code: 23
```

The exact command is:

```bash
/bin/bash -lc 'printf CODEX_FAILURE_STDERR_MARKER >&2; exit 23'
```

The user completed this check and explicitly accepted the behavior. Ticket
archival and repository finalization subsequently completed in DR-006.


## DR-004 Operational Launch Update

A direct AppImage launch on this minimal host failed before application startup
because its runtime requests unversioned `libz.so`, while the host provides
`libz.so.1`. Delivery therefore launched the exact verified unpacked package at
`electron-dist/linux-arm64-unpacked/autobyteus` with the container-required
`--no-sandbox` flag. That application ran with its ordinary embedded server at
port `29695`, production data root `/root/.autobyteus/server-data`, and a
visible 1200x800 X11 window. See `electron-user-launch-report.md`.

The earlier AppImage run command remains the artifact's intended interface, but
this report does not claim that the local AppImage is directly portable to this
minimal host without the missing library. The completed DR-004 hands-on session
used the unpacked payload instead.

## DR-006 Final Cleanup

After the user confirmed that the behavior works, Delivery stopped the packaged
application/backend, confirmed port `29695` closed, completed repository
finalization, and removed the verification-only `autobyteus-web/electron-dist`
output. The checksum and complete build/startup evidence above remain archived;
no published release asset was created or removed.
