# Electron User Launch Report — DR-004

## Request And Result

- User request: start the built Electron application for hands-on testing.
- Current result: `Pass — user completed hands-on testing and accepted the behavior; application stopped cleanly`.
- Started: `2026-09-01T12:42:56Z` using the verified unpacked payload from the DR-003 Linux ARM64 build.
- Electron root PID: `23250`
- Embedded server PID: `23335`
- Window evidence: X11 reported the interactive `autobyteus` application window
  at `1200x800` after startup and `1510x864` at the latest readiness check.
- Health: `http://127.0.0.1:29695/rest/health` returns `{"status":"ok","message":"Server is running"}`.
- Production data root: `/root/.autobyteus/server-data`
- Database result: 24 migrations recognized; no pending migration; migrations completed successfully.

## Launch Path And Host Constraint

The first normal AppImage launch attempt used:

`/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/autobyteus-web/electron-dist/AutoByteus_enterprise_linux-arm64-1.4.64.AppImage`

It exited before application startup because this minimal Linux host has the
runtime `libz.so.1` but not the unversioned `libz.so` requested by the ARM64
AppImage runtime. No application or database process started from that attempt.

Delivery then launched the exact already-built unpacked Electron payload:

`/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/autobyteus-web/electron-dist/linux-arm64-unpacked/autobyteus --no-sandbox`

`--no-sandbox` is limited to this root/container verification environment,
whose packaged `chrome-sandbox` is not setuid. The application itself uses its
ordinary production embedded port and data root; no E2E isolation variables are
set for this user-testing launch.

The AppImage host-library observation is not caused by the Codex failure-detail
source delta and does not prevent current hands-on testing through the unpacked
payload. It must not be represented as proof that this local AppImage is portable
to a minimal Linux host without the missing library. Ticket-scoped release and
publication remain not required.

## Evidence And Lifecycle

- Combined launch log:
  `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/codex-command-failure-detail/delivery-electron-user-launch-dr004.log`
- Historical root PID evidence file:
  `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/codex-command-failure-detail/delivery-electron-user-launch-dr004.pid`
- Current readiness evidence:
  `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/codex-command-failure-detail/delivery-user-launch-readiness-dr004.log`
- User acceptance: `2026-09-01 user message — “the task is done. i tested it
  works. lets finalize the ticket. no need to release a new version”`.
- Delivery requested graceful shutdown after acceptance. Electron exited after
  two seconds, the embedded backend stopped after one second, and port `29695`
  was confirmed closed at `2026-09-01T12:48:10Z`.

## Verification Target

Run a Codex-backed Agent or Team member through:

```bash
/bin/bash -lc 'printf CODEX_FAILURE_STDERR_MARKER >&2; exit 23'
```

The user completed the hands-on check and explicitly confirmed that it works.
No further user-verification action is pending unless a later target refresh
materially changes the accepted user-facing state.
