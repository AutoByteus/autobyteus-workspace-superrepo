# Docs Sync Report

## Scope

- Ticket: `codex-command-failure-detail`
- Current delivery revision: `DR-006`
- Trigger: explicit user acceptance of the DR-004 Electron session and authorization to finalize without a new release
- Bootstrap base reference: `80e2bd195c42ea3ced778dbc051d4d00edaef16f`
- Integrated base reference used for docs sync: `origin/personal@ad63d74275a4eb204ebc6d97a2260aa9790fea52`, integrated by merge `a14532534cbb618fd859d8e760f3baeafb1b01d7`
- Post-integration verification reference: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/codex-command-failure-detail/api-e2e-execution-coverage-report.md` (`API-REV-002`, evidence commit `e28c65f00e459c89bcb0fd9b47fff5e151ddbcfe`)

## Why Docs Were Updated

- Summary: Canonical server and frontend documentation now describes how failed Codex commands retain provider output/exit code in the existing failed-tool error, flow identically through standalone/Team transport and new local replay, and render as readable multiline content. The project-owned browser-probe command already added by API/E2E was retained during integration.
- Why this should live in long-lived project docs: The behavior is a durable provider-mapping, replay, and presentation contract needed by future converter, persistence, frontend, and test maintainers. Keeping it only in ticket evidence would leave the canonical Codex mapping docs incomplete.

## Long-Lived Docs Reviewed

| Doc Path | Why It Was Reviewed | Result (`Updated`/`No change`/`Needs follow-up`) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `autobyteus-server-ts/docs/modules/codex_integration.md` | Canonical Codex runtime, transport, memory, replay, and normalization contract. | `Updated` | Added command-failure diagnostic precedence, command-only scope, unchanged lifecycle shape, local replay behavior, and no-migration/no-backfill boundary. |
| `autobyteus-server-ts/docs/design/codex_raw_event_mapping.md` | Canonical raw App Server event-to-normalized-event audit. | `Updated` | Added detailed failed-command mapping and expanded the `item/completed(commandExecution)` audit row. |
| `autobyteus-web/docs/agent_execution_architecture.md` | Canonical frontend lifecycle/store/presentation ownership. | `Updated` | Recorded that conversation and Activity surfaces render the same canonical error verbatim with whitespace-preserving wrapping and must not parse raw provider envelopes. |
| `autobyteus-web/README.md` | Durable executable browser-probe inventory and usage. | `Updated upstream and integrated` | API/E2E added the Codex failure-detail probe; IR-002 retained it beside the current-base task-agent probe with one shared browser note. No additional Delivery edit was needed. |
| `autobyteus-web/docs/settings.md` | Contains generic tool lifecycle and presentation ownership guidance. | `No change` | Its runtime-agnostic failed-event handling remains accurate; detailed current presentation authority is maintained in `agent_execution_architecture.md`. |
| Root `README.md` and release guidance | Determine whether build, release, publication, or deployment documentation changed. | `No change` | Existing development and release instructions remain accurate; this ticket changes no packaging/deployment method. |

## Docs Updated

| Doc Path | Type Of Update | What Changed | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `autobyteus-server-ts/docs/modules/codex_integration.md` | Runtime contract | Documented explicit error precedence, `aggregatedOutput` plus valid non-zero `exitCode`, exit-only and generic fallbacks, unchanged failed state, identical transports, local `tool_error` replay, and no historical rewrite. | Preserve the final integrated provider-to-application behavior as canonical runtime knowledge. |
| `autobyteus-server-ts/docs/design/codex_raw_event_mapping.md` | Mapping audit | Added the exact failed-command content mapping and updated the terminal command audit row. | Make future App Server protocol/converter maintenance preserve the supported diagnostic boundary. |
| `autobyteus-web/docs/agent_execution_architecture.md` | Frontend presentation contract | Recorded shared verbatim/pre-wrap handling for conversation and Activity failures. | Prevent runtime-specific parsing or loss of multiline diagnostic content in either existing UI surface. |
| `autobyteus-web/README.md` | Executable coverage documentation | Retained the API/E2E-owned `test:e2e:codex-command-failure-detail` section and script inventory on the integrated base. | Keep the durable production-component browser probe discoverable and runnable. |

## Durable Design / Runtime Knowledge Promoted

| Topic | What Future Readers Need To Understand | Source Ticket Artifact(s) | Target Long-Lived Doc |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Command failure evidence precedence | A failed command uses non-empty explicit provider error/message first, otherwise aggregated output with a valid non-zero exit-code line, exit-code-only detail, then the generic fallback; blank fields and exit code zero do not fabricate detail. | `requirements-doc.md`; `implementation-handoff.md`; `api-e2e-execution-coverage-report.md` | `autobyteus-server-ts/docs/modules/codex_integration.md`; `autobyteus-server-ts/docs/design/codex_raw_event_mapping.md` |
| Contract containment | The command remains failed and uses the existing error string; no provider envelope, stdout/stderr fabrication, native `TerminalResult` parity, public event-shape change, or unrelated tool-family behavior is introduced. | Same | Same |
| Transport and persistence continuity | Standalone and Team carry the same normalized string; new raw traces store it as `tool_error`; old generic strings remain readable without migration/backfill; native history is not a normal replay fallback. | `api-e2e-execution-coverage-report.md`; durable transport/replay tests | Both server Codex docs |
| Multiline failure presentation | Center tool card and Activity render the same canonical error verbatim with whitespace-preserving wrapping rather than parsing raw provider data. | Browser evidence; `implementation-handoff.md` | `autobyteus-web/docs/agent_execution_architecture.md`; `autobyteus-web/README.md` |

## Removed / Replaced Components Recorded

| Old Component / Path / Concept | What Replaced It | Where The New Truth Is Documented |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Generic-only mapping for a failed Codex command that already contains actionable output/exit detail | Command-scoped diagnostic precedence in the existing failed-tool error string | Server Codex integration and raw-event mapping docs |
| Single-line-only center-card rendering for multiline failure text | Whitespace-preserving wrapping aligned with the existing Activity surface | Frontend agent execution architecture and web browser-probe README |

No component, API, schema, or persisted record format was removed.

## Verification

- Fresh delivery fetch: `origin/personal` remained `ad63d74275a4eb204ebc6d97a2260aa9790fea52` and is already an ancestor of validated HEAD `e28c65f00e459c89bcb0fd9b47fff5e151ddbcfe`; divergence was `7 ahead / 0 behind`.
- No additional behavioral rerun was needed because `API-REV-002` validated that exact HEAD against the same unchanged base immediately before docs sync, and Delivery changed documentation/handoff artifacts only.
- Markdown/patch hygiene, source-to-doc assertions, package-script/README target consistency, no-unmerged-state, and artifact presence checks passed.
- Evidence: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/codex-command-failure-detail/delivery-evidence/dr-002-docs-sync-and-handoff.log`.

## Delivery Continuation

- Result: `Pass`
- Next delivery action: Repository finalization and safe cleanup are complete. Return the authoritative terminal package through current handoff rules. Release/version/tag/deployment work is explicitly not required.
- Notes: Task size `Small`, architectural risk `Low`, and `Direct Low-Risk` route are preserved. Architecture/source-review artifacts remain `N/A — not applicable`; no route reclassification occurred.

## Blocked Or Escalated Follow-Up

`N/A — docs sync completed truthfully on the integrated, API/E2E-passed state.`


### DR-003 Electron Build Re-entry Check

- The user requested the documented Electron build for hands-on testing.
- Root and web README instructions selected the native Linux ARM64 command `pnpm -C autobyteus-web build:electron:linux:arm64`; it built and the project/release-owned artifact checks passed.
- The instructions remain accurate: the generated AppImage is in `autobyteus-web/electron-dist`, contains the integrated backend, and the packaged runtime starts the server and Electron window successfully.
- Result: `Pass — no additional long-lived documentation edit required`. Build facts belong in `electron-build-linux-report.md`; they do not alter the durable runtime/mapping contract synchronized in DR-002.


### DR-004 User Launch Re-entry Check

- The exact unpacked packaged Electron payload ran for user testing with the ordinary production embedded port/data contract; the user accepted the behavior and Delivery stopped the owned process tree cleanly.
- The AppImage wrapper's missing unversioned `libz.so` on this minimal host is recorded in the ticket-local launch report; it does not change the documented Codex mapping, replay, or presentation behavior.
- Result: `Pass — no additional long-lived documentation edit required`; no portability claim or release action is inferred from the local launch.


### DR-005 Post-Acceptance Finalization Check

- The user explicitly confirmed that the tested behavior works and requested ticket finalization without a new version.
- Delivery refreshed `origin/personal` after that signal. It remained `ad63d74275a4eb204ebc6d97a2260aa9790fea52`, already contained by the accepted ticket state (`0 behind / 9 ahead` before the archive commit), so no base change or user-facing delta required renewed verification.
- Post-acceptance checks passed: focused server `5 files / 87 tests`, focused frontend `2 files / 12 tests`, diff/ancestry/merge-state, integrated README/package probe inventory, and repository artifact hygiene.
- Ticket artifacts were moved to `tickets/done/codex-command-failure-detail`; archival changes do not alter the synchronized runtime behavior.
- Result: `Pass — canonical documentation remains current; no additional long-lived documentation edit required during finalization`.


### DR-006 Repository Finalization Check

- Ticket commit `ff09ad56132a1c4f507d479e6d3514d9348d1890` and target merge `c226a5593f5dac0a85bd8b5a9d05074f41fedb94` contain the same synchronized runtime documentation and accepted implementation.
- Finalization changed repository placement/integration state only; it did not change provider mapping, transport/replay, frontend presentation, compatibility, packaging instructions, or deployment topology.
- Result: `Pass — no additional long-lived documentation edit required`; the archived ticket and final delivery artifacts are the appropriate authority for finalization history.
