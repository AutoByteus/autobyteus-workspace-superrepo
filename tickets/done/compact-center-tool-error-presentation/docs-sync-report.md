# Docs Sync Report

## Scope

- Ticket: `compact-center-tool-error-presentation` (`AUT-WEB-COMPACT-TOOL-ERROR-001`)
- Trigger: Delivery ingress after direct-route API/E2E `API-REV-001` passed at `19413c3a95dcc20398767387b69a818a288359f8` with 99% confidence.
- Bootstrap base reference: `origin/personal@29fffb99a2219bd0848697b01001228e4568b287` from `investigation-notes.md`.
- Integrated base reference used for docs sync: `origin/personal@29fffb99a2219bd0848697b01001228e4568b287`; it is already an ancestor of validated HEAD `19413c3a95dcc20398767387b69a818a288359f8`.
- Post-integration verification reference: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/compact-center-tool-error-presentation/delivery-evidence/dr-001-integration-refresh.log`; `git merge --ff-only origin/personal` returned `Already up to date`.

## Why Docs Were Updated

- Summary: The durable Agent Execution Architecture now describes the intentional progressive-disclosure split for failed tools: the center event stream keeps only compact failure status/name/context, while Activity retains the exact diagnostic behind a default-collapsed Error subsection.
- Why this should live in long-lived project docs: The prior canonical paragraph explicitly said both center and Activity rendered the same failure text verbatim. That statement became obsolete when the approved ticket superseded duplicate center detail and default-open Activity Error behavior.

## Long-Lived Docs Reviewed

| Doc Path | Why It Was Reviewed | Result (`Updated`/`No change`/`Needs follow-up`) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `autobyteus-web/docs/agent_execution_architecture.md` | Canonical owner/surface description for `AgentActivityStore`, `ToolCallIndicator`, and `ToolActivityItem`; contained the superseded duplicate-display statement. | `Updated` | Records compact center presentation, default-collapsed Activity Error, explicit disclosure, exact retained diagnostic, and unchanged transport ownership. |
| `autobyteus-web/docs/settings.md` | Contains related activity projection and component ownership guidance. | `No change` | It identifies the component boundaries but does not carry the obsolete duplicate/default-open error-detail assertion. |
| `autobyteus-web/README.md` and root `README.md` | Checked for user-facing tool-error presentation claims. | `No change` | Neither documents this component-level disclosure default. |
| `autobyteus-server-ts/docs/` | Checked whether server error transport documentation became inaccurate. | `No change` | Provider enrichment, wire payload, persistence, replay, and schema behavior are intentionally unchanged. |

## Docs Updated

| Doc Path | Type Of Update | What Changed | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `autobyteus-web/docs/agent_execution_architecture.md` | Runtime/UI presentation contract | Replaced the claim that both surfaces render the diagnostic with the final progressive-disclosure contract. | Prevents future work from restoring the center error flood or auto-opening Activity Error while preserving the canonical diagnostic. |

## Durable Design / Runtime Knowledge Promoted

| Topic | What Future Readers Need To Understand | Source Ticket Artifact(s) | Target Long-Lived Doc |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Failed-tool progressive disclosure | `ToolCallIndicator` renders status/name/context only; `ToolActivityItem` owns on-demand detailed failure presentation. | `requirements-doc.md`; `implementation-handoff.md`; `api-e2e-execution-coverage-report.md` | `autobyteus-web/docs/agent_execution_architecture.md` |
| Diagnostic preservation | UI compaction must not truncate, rewrite, parse, or independently reconstruct the Activity/persisted error string. | `requirements-doc.md` BEH-003/REQ-004/REQ-005; browser and server API/E2E evidence | `autobyteus-web/docs/agent_execution_architecture.md` |
| Default disclosure state | Activity Error begins collapsed and selection/highlighting must not open it; explicit expansion preserves multiline content. | `requirements-doc.md` REQ-008; API/E2E browser evidence | `autobyteus-web/docs/agent_execution_architecture.md` |

## Removed / Replaced Components Recorded

| Old Component / Path / Concept | What Replaced It | Where The New Truth Is Documented |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Inline center `tool-error-message` body | No detailed center body; existing compact failed row remains navigable to Activity. | `autobyteus-web/docs/agent_execution_architecture.md` |
| Activity Error default-open state | Default-collapsed Error subsection with explicit open/collapse/reopen. | `autobyteus-web/docs/agent_execution_architecture.md` |
| Canonical statement that both surfaces render the same error verbatim | Progressive disclosure with one preserved diagnostic and two intentionally different presentation surfaces. | `autobyteus-web/docs/agent_execution_architecture.md` |

## No-Impact Decision (Use Only If Truly No Docs Changes Are Needed)

- Docs impact: `N/A — docs impact existed and was addressed.`
- Rationale: `N/A`

## Delivery Continuation

- Result: `Pass`
- Next delivery action: Present the integrated, docs-synchronized handoff for explicit user verification; hold archive, commit/push, target merge, release, and cleanup until the user accepts it.
- Notes: No new base commits were integrated, so API/E2E evidence remains applicable to the same validated candidate state. Architecture design/review, source review, and proportional test-code review are `N/A — direct Medium/Low route`.

## Blocked Or Escalated Follow-Up (Use Only If Docs Sync Cannot Complete)

- Classification: `N/A`
- Recommended recipient: `N/A`
- Why docs could not be finalized truthfully: `N/A`
