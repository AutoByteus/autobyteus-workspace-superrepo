## Initial Request And Clarifications

- Original request: Investigate why a failed command shows a very long, mostly normal-looking output in the center event-monitor area, then improve the UI so the middle area does not display detailed error content; existing red failed treatment is enough because the right-side Activity item already provides Error detail.
- Clarifications received: The user emphasized that the center failed state should use the same simple-row information hierarchy as a normal/successful tool row, only red and without inline Error content. The user then clarified that the right-side Activity Error subsection must also start closed like Result, so the user explicitly chooses whether to open it; navigation/highlighting is not an instruction to auto-open Error.
- User-supplied facts and constraints: Three screenshots identify the center flooding, the existing Activity diagnostic surface, and the current default-open Error state; raw traces under AutoByteus memory were suggested as the evidence source.
- Initial ambiguity: Whether the example represented a false failure or a genuine command failure with accumulated stdout; whether the no-detail rule applies only to `run_bash` or the shared failed tool card. Investigation resolved the first; the user's package approval accepted the shared-card scope in `ASM-002`.

## Product And Domain Understanding

- Product area: AutoByteus event-monitor conversation and right-side Activity presentation for tool invocations.
- Affected actors or systems: Users monitoring active/replayed standalone or team-member agent runs; frontend tool lifecycle projection; compact center tool card; detailed Activity item.
- Existing user or operational purpose: The center stream communicates run progression at a glance; Activity provides detailed tool arguments, logs, result/error, status, and invocation identity.
- Relevant terminology:
  - Center event monitor: the middle conversation/timeline area that renders `ToolCallIndicator` for tool events.
  - Activity: the right-side tab/list that renders `ToolActivityItem` and detailed sections.
  - Error string: the authoritative normalized failure diagnostic carried by the tool lifecycle and stored as both segment error and Activity error.
  - Aggregated output: provider/tool failure content that can contain normal stdout/stderr accumulated before a non-zero exit.

## Source Log

| Date | Source Type (`Code`/`Doc`/`Runtime`/`Data`/`Contract`/`Web`/`User`/`Command`/`Other`) | Exact Source / Command / Query | Why Consulted | Relevant Finding | Follow-Up |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-09-02 | User | Initial request and two supplied screenshots | Establish desired presentation and evidence target | Center detail is unwanted; existing red state is enough; Activity is the detailed surface | Capture as target behavior and preserve Activity |
| 2026-09-02 | User | Follow-up clarification and third screenshot | Resolve Activity initial-state behavior | Center should match the normal/successful simple row except for red failure state; Activity Error must be closed by default like Result and opened only by user choice | Record as `RER-002`, `REQ-008`, `AC-010`, and `DEC-002` |
| 2026-09-02 | User | “Yes, approved.” in direct response to the `RER-002` review summary | Establish approval authority | User explicitly approved the complete revised behavior: compact red center row, no center error body, default-collapsed Activity Error, explicit expansion, and preserved full diagnostic | Record `RER-003`, close `DEC-001`/`DEC-002`/`ASM-002`, pass readiness, and assess route |

| 2026-09-02 | Command | Re-executed the final `rg ... design-spec.md \| head -1400` pipeline with `pipefail` and captured `PIPESTATUS` | Determine why normal text was classified as error | `head` succeeded; `rg` returned 1 after producing 1,400 of 2,026 matching/context lines; pipeline failure stops the shell | Record as high-confidence broken-pipe/capped-pipeline inference, not a frontend misclassification |
| 2026-09-02 | Code | `autobyteus-web/services/agentStreaming/handlers/toolLifecycleHandler.ts:404-437` | Trace frontend failure state | Failed payload updates segment error and Activity error with the same string | Keep data path unchanged |
| 2026-09-02 | Code | `autobyteus-web/utils/toolCardPresentation.ts:94-123` | Trace center presentation input | Presentation copies `segment.error` into `errorMessage` and includes it in witness values | Downstream must reconcile presentation/test contract without erasing Activity data |
| 2026-09-02 | Code | `autobyteus-web/components/conversation/ToolCallIndicator.vue:1-162` | Verify center rendering and navigation | Lines 63-67 render complete error; failed border/icon already exist; clicking opens Activity and highlights invocation | Remove center detail behavior while preserving header/navigation outcomes |
| 2026-09-02 | Code | `autobyteus-web/components/progress/ToolActivityItem.vue:34-145` | Verify detailed surface and section defaults | Activity has an outer-card state `isExpanded = true`; `sectionStates` initializes Arguments, Logs, and Result to `false` but Error to `true`; Error body renders with `v-show` | Preserve the outer card and other section defaults; change Error's initial state to closed without removing content |
| 2026-09-02 | Test | `autobyteus-web/components/conversation/__tests__/ToolCallIndicator.spec.ts` | Locate durable current expectations | Tests require one-line and multiline inline center errors and navigation | Replace superseded assertions; retain navigation/status coverage |
| 2026-09-02 | Test | `autobyteus-web/components/progress/__tests__/ToolActivityItem.spec.ts` | Check Activity disclosure coverage | Existing focused fixture uses `error: null`; no failed-Error initial-collapse/explicit-expansion contract was found | Add focused short/large-error disclosure coverage downstream |
| 2026-09-02 | Test | `autobyteus-web/tests/e2e/codex-command-failure-detail-probe.mjs` and fixture | Locate rendered current expectation | Browser probe explicitly requires identical diagnostic in center and Activity at desktop/narrow widths | Revise probe to compact center plus complete Activity detail |

| 2026-09-02 | Command | `pnpm -C autobyteus-web exec vitest run ... --no-watch` | Attempt a fresh focused baseline | Not executable in current environment: `pnpm: command not found` | Downstream must run focused tests in a prepared project environment |

## Relevant Existing Behavior And Supported Product Paths

| Behavior ID | Kind | Supported Trigger Or Governing Contract | Current Supported Product Behavior Path / Lifecycle | Current Outcome / Invariants | Evidence | Confidence / Unknown |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `BEH-001` | User | User observes a supported tool failure in the center event monitor | Failure event hydrates a tool segment; shared tool-card presentation receives its error; center card renders the complete string below the header | Failed state is obvious, but card height scales with error length and duplicates Activity | Screenshot, component, tests, delivered prior package | High |
| `BEH-002` | User | User clicks/keyboard-activates a non-approval center tool card or opens Activity | Frontend selects progress/Activity tab and highlights matching invocation; outer Activity card is open; Arguments/Logs/Result default closed; Error default open | Exact arguments/error are available, but large errors immediately flood Activity without user choice | Three screenshots; `ToolActivityItem.vue`; navigation source | High |
| `BEH-003` | System | `TOOL_EXECUTION_FAILED` for a valid invocation | Handler parses event, updates failed segment, updates matching Activity status, and writes the same error into Activity; replay later hydrates the same facts | One canonical diagnostic is available to multiple UI surfaces | Handler/types/prior package | High; full replay not re-executed during bootstrap |
| `BEH-004` | Contract | Failure diagnostic is arbitrarily large/multiline | No center-specific size guard exists; template interpolates entire error string | Very large payload produces very large center DOM/visible output | Raw trace and screenshot | High |

## Relevant Codebase And Technical Facts

| Path / Component / Contract | Current Responsibility Or Behavior | Requirement Implication | Architecture Question Deferred Downstream |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `services/agentStreaming/handlers/toolLifecycleHandler.ts` | Copies failed error into both conversation segment and Activity | Preserve authoritative state and correlation | Exact production path should continue to feed Activity while center stops rendering detail |
| `utils/toolCardPresentation.ts` | Maps segment state into shared center-card presentation, including `errorMessage` | Current presentation contract exposes a now-unwanted center detail | Whether to retain/remove/reshape this presentation field is downstream-owned provided no Activity/replay data is lost |
| `components/conversation/ToolCallIndicator.vue` | Renders status/header, inline error body, approval controls, and Activity navigation | Target center behavior is localized here at observable level | Exact template/component change is downstream-owned |
| `components/progress/ToolActivityItem.vue` | Renders detailed arguments/logs/result/error and status; currently initializes Error open while Result is closed | Becomes the sole on-demand detailed error surface; Error must adopt Result's collapsed default | Exact change is downstream-owned; outer-card and other section behavior must remain unchanged |
| `components/conversation/__tests__/ToolCallIndicator.spec.ts` | Protects current inline error and navigation behavior | Conflicting assertions must be updated | Test structure is downstream-owned |
| `tests/e2e/codex-command-failure-detail-*` | Proves both center and Activity contain identical full diagnostic | Durable browser contract conflicts with new request | Update rather than retain a legacy duplicate-behavior path |
| Prior ticket artifacts | Approved and delivered detailed command error to both surfaces | New package needs explicit supersession | Preserve backend/Activity portions; no parallel old/new UX |

## Structural And Payload Surface Inventory

### Payload Or Content Surfaces

- Files, records, documents, catalogs, fixtures, or generated payloads: Tool error strings from one line to hundreds of kilobytes; current browser test diagnostic fixture; two user screenshots.
- Existing readers, writers, or contracts that consume them: Streaming handler writes segment and Activity; center card reads segment-derived presentation; Activity reads its record; trace/replay preserves data.
- Evidence paths: `observed-long-failure-analysis.md`; source/test paths above.

### Structural Surfaces

- Runtime modules, shared interfaces, routes, APIs, persistence boundaries, security/concurrency controls, deployment configuration, or ownership boundaries: Frontend segment/activity state projection, shared tool-card presentation interface, center component, Activity component and independent outer/section disclosure states, navigation/highlight store calls, browser/component tests.
- Existing structural surfaces that can support the approved behavior: Activity already stores/renders full detail independently and has per-section toggles; Result already demonstrates the required collapsed default; center card already navigates to the exact Activity item and has red failed styling.
- Evidence paths: Source log and codebase facts above.

### Potential Architecture-Design Triggers

- API or external-contract change: Not required; explicitly out of scope.
- Persistence schema or invariant change: Not required; diagnostic retention is preserved.
- Security or privacy boundary change: None intended.
- Concurrency or lifecycle change: None intended.
- Deployment, migration, ownership-boundary, architectural-pattern, or structural-refactoring change: None evident at requirements stage; a shared presentation/test contract changes but product architecture need not.
- Confirmed absent, present, or unknown: Confirmed absent for the approved scope. The post-approval assessment found no API/external contract, persisted-data invariant, security/privacy, concurrency/lifecycle, deployment, ownership, migration, new-pattern, or structural-refactoring trigger.

## Runtime, Probe, Or Reproduction Findings

| Method / Command | Scenario | Observation | Requirement Implication | Artifact / Evidence Path |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Raw JSONL record inspection | Exact screenshot failure | One failed `run_bash`; `tool_error` 348,978 characters/1,915 lines; preceding output is preserved; final marker is `Exit code: 1` | UI must handle extreme error length without center flooding | `observed-long-failure-analysis.md` |
| Section-marker analysis | Determine where compound command stopped | Output contains Implementation, IR, Requirements, and Design sections, but never reaches Architecture Review marker | Failure occurred during Design search pipeline, after large amounts of valid output | Same supplement |
| Exact capped pipeline reproduction | Explain normal-looking output in `tool_error` | Search produced 2,026 lines; `head` retained 1,400; `rg` returned 1, so `pipefail` made the compound command fail | Backend failure classification is consistent with shell status; UI hierarchy, not classification, is the requested fix | Same supplement |
| Focused frontend unit command | Fresh baseline | Could not run because `pnpm` is absent in current shell image | No pass/fail implementation claim; downstream validation required | Source Log command entry |

## Stakeholder And User Evidence

| Source / Actor | Need, Problem, Or Constraint | Evidence Strength | Requirement Implication | Open Question |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| User | Center event monitor must not be flooded by detailed command error output | Direct | No center error body or excerpt | None material |
| User | Existing red error treatment is enough in center | Direct | Preserve red failed styling/icon and compact metadata | Exact shade/layout remains existing design-system behavior |
| User | Right Activity provides full Error detail but currently opens it automatically | Direct | Preserve full detail and navigation, but initialize Error closed like Result and open only on explicit user action | No material open question; outer Activity card remains unchanged |
| Prior approved package | Diagnostic must be retained and useful | Strong historical contract | Supersede only duplication/default disclosure, not transport/data/detail availability | Supersession explicitly approved in this package on 2026-09-02 |

## External Contracts, Standards, And Dependencies

| Contract / Dependency | Version / Authority | Relevant Behavior Or Constraint | Evidence | Unknown / Risk |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tool failure event | Current AutoByteus frontend stream types | Carries valid non-empty error and invocation identity | Handler/parser/types | No schema change needed |
| Center tool-card presentation | Current `ToolCardPresentation` | Includes status/summary/error/navigation data | Utility/component/tests | Presentation field may become obsolete for center; downstream owns cleanup |
| Activity record | Current `ToolActivity` | Holds complete error separately | Store/type/component | None for requested behavior |
| Prior requirements | `REQ-CODEX-COMMAND-FAILURE-DETAIL-20260901` / `RER-002` | Requires detail transport and currently requires duplicate UI | Done ticket | Must be superseded precisely, not silently violated |

## Persisted Data And State Facts

- Affected stored or external subject: Existing raw trace and locally recorded/replayed tool-error state.
- Location and representative shape: Tool invocation record with status, arguments, `result`, and `error`; example raw trace path recorded in the Source Log.
- Approximate volume: Example error is 348,978 characters / 1,915 lines; general volume is unbounded at requirements level.
- Current readers and writers: Provider/backend emits error; frontend streaming/hydration writes segment and Activity state; center and Activity components read their respective projections; raw trace/replay retains it.
- Current unknown/extra-field behavior: Not relevant; no shape change requested.
- Required semantics or data that must be preserved: Exact error availability, invocation correlation, failed status, arguments, ordering, and replay.
- Acceptable loss, reset, rebuild, or regeneration: None for product data; test fixtures may be regenerated.
- Privacy, retention, compliance, downtime, or operational constraints: Do not commit the giant raw payload; retain only metrics/identifiers and user-provided visual evidence.
- Remaining evidence gap: Downstream must prove byte-equivalent Activity/replay detail after center change.

## Product Design Request Context

- Product Design request in the current input: `Not stated`
- User's requested outcome, in the user's own terms: Middle area should be a simple row like normal/successful tool activity, only red, and should not show error content; right-side Activity Error should be closed by default like Result so the user chooses to open it.
- Requirement / behavior IDs involved: `BEH-001`, `BEH-002`; `REQ-001`–`REQ-004`, `REQ-008`
- Product decision, uncertainty, or experience to understand or evolve: Already stated clearly; no separate Product Design & Prototyping request was made.
- Critical journey and states: Compact failed center row; navigation/highlight of matching Activity item; default-collapsed Error heading; explicit user expansion; complete Activity detail; re-collapse and replay.
- Known constraints and non-goals: No new surface, excerpt, backend change, or Activity redesign; do not collapse the outer Activity card or change Result/Arguments/Logs defaults; do not auto-open Error on navigation/highlight.
- Relevant existing-product or frontend context supplied or established: Three screenshots and current production components/tests.
- Product Design request artifact / message reference: `N/A — no Product Design handoff requested`
- Established separate prototype repository/root and ticket reference, when applicable: `N/A — not applicable`

## Product Design Findings

- Product Design package path (external Product Design & Prototyping repository): `N/A — not requested`
- Visualizer or prototype source path: `N/A — not requested`
- Approved UI/UX specification path, when applicable: `N/A — not applicable`
- Review URL: `N/A — not applicable`
- Explicit user-confirmation reference: On 2026-09-02 the user replied “Yes, approved.” directly to the `RER-002` review summary covering compact center status and default-collapsed Activity Error.
- Journeys and scenarios validated: Current-state only through screenshots/source.
- Final visual-reference paths: `N/A — no future-state prototype`
- Product decisions supported by evidence: Compact red center row; Activity Error collapsed by default like Result; full detail after explicit expansion.
- Alternatives rejected or still open: Center excerpt/collapsed center details rejected in proposed `DEC-001`; Activity auto-open on render/replay/navigation rejected in proposed `DEC-002`.
- Mocked boundaries and production gaps: No future-state executable visual yet; downstream browser validation required.
- Requirements sections affected: UI, requirements, acceptance criteria, prior-requirement supersession.

## Assumptions, Unknowns, And Risks

| ID | Type (`Assumption`/`Unknown`/`Risk`) | Description | Why It Matters | Resolution / Owner | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `AUR-001` | Assumption | No-detail applies to all failed invocations using the shared center tool card, not only `run_bash` | Avoids inconsistent UX and matches surface-level user wording | Accepted through user approval of `ASM-002` | Resolved |
| `AUR-002` | Risk | An implementation may hide error visually but leave hundreds of kilobytes in center accessible text/DOM | Would retain usability/performance problems | `AC-002` DOM/accessibility/geometry validation | Open until validation |
| `AUR-003` | Risk | Removing the error before Activity projection could erase the user's diagnostic | Would violate the central information-hierarchy intent | Preserve event/Activity/replay state; `AC-004`–`AC-006` | Open until validation |
| `AUR-004` | Risk | Prior durable tests enforce the now-unwanted duplicate presentation | Implementation could appear broken until tests are coherently revised, or retain legacy duplication | Explicit supersession and `AC-008` | Open until implementation |
| `AUR-005` | Risk | Current environment lacks `pnpm`, so focused baseline tests were not freshly executed | Source and delivered evidence are strong, but current executable baseline is unconfirmed here | Downstream prepared-environment validation | Expected |
| `AUR-006` | Risk | Selection/highlight or replay logic could auto-expand Error after its component default is changed | Would violate explicit user control and recreate Activity flooding in important paths | Validate direct render, live failure, replay, and center navigation against `REQ-008`/`AC-010` | Open until validation |

## Requirement Implications

- The observed tool was correctly marked failed according to its process exit status; the large red body is mostly valid output accumulated before failure. The requested fix is presentation hierarchy, not reclassification.
- Error detail must remain canonical and complete for Activity/replay. Compacting the center by truncating shared state would be incorrect.
- The existing center red border/icon and Activity navigation already implement most desired behavior; the unwanted center behavior is the inline body. In Activity, the unwanted behavior is specifically `sectionStates.error: true`; the outer card and Result/other section defaults are preserved.
- The prior command-failure-detail package intentionally introduced/validated duplicate detailed rendering. This ticket is a material but narrow UI supersession explicitly approved on 2026-09-02.
- Very large payload validation is mandatory; testing only a one-line error would miss both the center and default-open Activity flooding modes.
- The user's normal/success comparison establishes a consistent information hierarchy: center rows summarize status, while right-side detail sections reveal content on demand.

## Notes For Downstream Architecture Design Or Direct Implementation

- Use approved `SCN-001` through `SCN-004` as the product scenario basis.
- Keep the right Activity error string and trace/replay contract authoritative. Do not solve the UI issue by changing backend enrichment or discarding `segment.error` before Activity has it; collapsed means not shown by default, not deleted or truncated.
- Reconcile `ToolCardPresentation` witness values and both current component/browser tests rather than introducing a compatibility switch that keeps old duplicate behavior.
- Retain center navigation/highlighting and keyboard activation for failed cards; navigation and highlighting must not auto-expand Activity Error.
- Update the existing `codex-command-failure-detail` fixture/probe to assert intentionally different center and Activity content roles, default-collapsed Activity Error, and complete detail after explicit expansion.
- Run with a deterministic very large error fixture and inspect center DOM/accessibility text, center height, Activity's pre-expansion visible content/geometry, explicit toggle behavior, vertical/horizontal scroll behavior, and post-expansion Activity completeness at desktop and narrow widths.
