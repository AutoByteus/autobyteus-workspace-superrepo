# Handoff Summary

## Ticket And Route

- Ticket: `compact-center-tool-error-presentation` (`AUT-WEB-COMPACT-TOOL-ERROR-001`)
- Ticket branch: `requirements/compact-center-tool-error-presentation`
- Finalization target: `personal` / `origin/personal`
- Task size: `Medium`
- Architectural risk: `Low`
- Selected route: Direct implementation -> direct API/E2E -> Delivery.
- Architecture design/review: `N/A — not applicable`
- Source review: `N/A — not applicable`
- Proportional API/E2E test-code review: `N/A — direct low-risk route`
- Current state: Delivery completed. User verification, repository finalization, stable `v1.4.66` publication, rollout verification, and safe cleanup all passed.

## User-Facing Change

- A failed tool card in the center event stream is now a compact red failed row with its tool name and existing compact context summary; it renders no inline diagnostic text.
- Clicking the row or activating it with Enter/Space still opens Activity and highlights the exact invocation.
- The Activity item remains expanded, but its Error subsection now begins collapsed and stays collapsed on creation, replay, direct view, highlighting, and center-row selection.
- Explicitly opening Error reveals the complete authoritative multiline diagnostic; collapse/reopen preserves the same content.
- Successful, running, approval, denied, interrupted, Result-disclosure, transport, persistence, replay, and backend error-enrichment behavior remain unchanged.

## Integrated-State Delivery Checkpoint

- Bootstrap and latest tracked base: `origin/personal@29fffb99a2219bd0848697b01001228e4568b287`.
- Validated candidate before Delivery: `19413c3a95dcc20398767387b69a818a288359f8` on implementation `c09a241dab9fc31482e89d2be474b0556c889135`.
- Delivery fetch: `git fetch --prune origin` on 2026-09-02; `origin/personal` remained the bootstrap base and is an ancestor of the candidate.
- Integration method/result: `Already current`; `git merge --ff-only origin/personal` returned `Already up to date`.
- Post-integration rerun: Not required because no base commit entered after API/E2E validation; Delivery changed only the canonical architecture paragraph and delivery artifacts.
- Evidence: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/compact-center-tool-error-presentation/delivery-evidence/dr-001-integration-refresh.log`.

## Documentation Sync

- Result: `Pass`.
- Updated: `autobyteus-web/docs/agent_execution_architecture.md`.
- Report: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/compact-center-tool-error-presentation/docs-sync-report.md`.
- Durable truth: failed-tool detail is preserved in Activity/persistence, omitted from the compact center card, and default-collapsed until explicit Activity disclosure.

## Validation Evidence

- API/E2E result: `Pass`, `API-REV-001`, 99% final confidence; every critical AC directly proven and no category below 90%.
- Actual Nuxt/Chromium: 4/4 durable scenarios passed at desktop and 390px narrow widths across standalone/Team and live/replay state.
- Navigation: Click, Enter, and Space selected the exact Activity invocation without auto-opening Error.
- Progressive disclosure: Direct/highlight Activity remained collapsed; explicit open/collapse/reopen preserved the exact 348,978-character, 1,915-line diagnostic.
- Web regression coverage: 108 relevant tests passed across 11 files; both boundary guards passed.
- Server/transport/replay: 7 focused tests passed across current standalone/Team transport and GraphQL replay.
- Real provider: Focused real Codex App Server failed-command persistence test passed.
- Persisted data: `Not Affected`; no migration, fallback, model, transport, or schema change.
- Repository-wide typecheck: completed with 3,131 unrelated baseline diagnostics and named no changed implementation/API/E2E path; it is reported as a baseline failure, not a pass.
- API/E2E artifacts and exact commands: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/compact-center-tool-error-presentation/api-e2e-execution-coverage-report.md` and `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/compact-center-tool-error-presentation/probes/api-e2e/`.

## Residual Risk

- No single real-model Team failure was driven through the entire routed browser UI. This is bounded because the real provider, Team wire equality, current replay, production dispatch, and browser-store seams were directly exercised.
- The unrelated repository-wide typecheck baseline remains non-clean; no changed candidate or API/E2E path appears in those diagnostics.
- No Electron preload, IPC, native window, packaging, or shell lifecycle boundary changed, so browser validation is the applicable desktop-equivalent surface.

## User Verification And Finalization

- Verification reference: User message on 2026-09-02: `now finalize and release thanks.`
- Accepted state protection: Local checkpoint `b65d57593d1cd978d11fe9ce88ba9a3a64be2b12` contains the validated package, synchronized architecture doc, and DR-001 handoff.
- Post-acceptance refresh: `origin/personal` remained `29fffb99a2219bd0848697b01001228e4568b287`, already an ancestor of the accepted checkpoint. No re-integration or renewed verification was required.
- Ticket archive: Moved to `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/compact-center-tool-error-presentation` before the final ticket-branch commit.
- Release authorization: Stable `v1.4.66`, verified absent locally/remotely and next after package version/tag `1.4.65` / `v1.4.65`.
- Evidence: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/compact-center-tool-error-presentation/delivery-evidence/dr-002-user-verification-refresh.log`.
- Repository finalization: Archived ticket commit `80e0d8e257d50801bfd0d883eb4cbb0c38feda5b` was pushed on `requirements/compact-center-tool-error-presentation`; merge commit `0bda9b2406a9d4a7ad190fcd6719c03153996483` was pushed to `personal` and verified remotely.
- Finalization evidence: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/compact-center-tool-error-presentation/delivery-evidence/dr-003-repository-finalization.log`.
- Stable release: `v1.4.66` at release commit `14778528eddb00237c5e1b3a0df0d665fc6a3646`; release URL: `https://github.com/AutoByteus/autobyteus-workspace/releases/tag/v1.4.66`.
- Publication result: All five tag-triggered workflows passed; the GitHub release is stable and contains 21 assets.
- Server container: `autobyteus/autobyteus-server:1.4.66` and `:latest` both resolve to `sha256:63ae5e080162c13167a5cadea36125ffe010fd5d6553a0c308a2538c9ea68787` for linux/amd64 and linux/arm64.
- iOS: App Store Connect/TestFlight upload succeeded for `1.4.66 (128)`; no App Store review/public release was requested or performed.
- Cleanup: Local and remote ticket branches were deleted only after ancestry against `personal` and `v1.4.66` passed; no dedicated worktree existed.
- Release and cleanup report: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/compact-center-tool-error-presentation/release-deployment-report.md`.
- Terminal state: Package is eligible for the required rules-based return to Requirements Engineering.
