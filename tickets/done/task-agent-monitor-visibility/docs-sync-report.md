# Docs Sync Report

## Scope

- Ticket: `task-agent-monitor-visibility`
- Current trigger: Delivery re-entry after `DR-003`, corrected solution `SR-006` / `ARCH-REV-006`, implementation `IR-003`, source review `CRR-005 Pass` at 9.42/10, API/E2E `API-REV-003 Pass` at 97.9% confidence, and `CRR-006 Not Applicable` because API-REV-003 left no durable test-code diff.
- Bootstrap base reference: `origin/personal` / `personal` at `80e2bd195c42ea3ced778dbc051d4d00edaef16f`.
- Integrated base reference used for current docs sync: latest fetched `origin/personal` remains `80e2bd195c42ea3ced778dbc051d4d00edaef16f`; corrected candidate HEAD `fe9f1a286b37ce53d33999b1155bd189822a0a24` is ahead by three commits and behind by zero.
- Post-integration verification reference: `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/task-agent-monitor-visibility/tickets/done/task-agent-monitor-visibility/delivery-integrated-state-refresh.log`. No base commit was integrated, so no merge-induced executable rerun was required. API-REV-003 validates the exact corrected candidate; current documentation/configuration validation is appended to `docs-sync-validation.log`.

## Why Docs Were Updated

- Summary: Long-lived server and frontend architecture docs now cover the complete corrected boundary: `TeamExecutionViewState` remains the sole exact-focus authority; a mounted task shell is not retained-projection authority; exact conversation/Activity hydration succeeds before focus; and the registry-owned durability gate publishes task activation before draining and forwarding exact task-Agent events. The docs preserve FIFO/reentrant/exactly-once release, abort/disposal safety, exact-run frontend routing, same-address isolation, settlement fallback reconciliation, and independent task-lifecycle/Agent-execution labels. The frontend README/package manifest continue exposing the durable deterministic probe and its owned-cleanup contract.
- Why this should live in long-lived project docs: These are persistent cross-boundary runtime ownership, event-ordering, and operator rerun contracts. Without them, future changes could reintroduce split focus authority, render a live-created empty task shell as authoritative, strand post-activation Agent events behind a private publisher, reorder activation and task frames, alias same-address runs, infer task completion from Agent status/message wording, or leave the deterministic regression probe undiscoverable.

## Long-Lived Docs Reviewed

| Doc Path | Why It Was Reviewed | Result (`Updated`/`No change`/`Needs follow-up`) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/task-agent-monitor-visibility/autobyteus-web/docs/agent_execution_architecture.md` | Canonical frontend runtime ownership, run-history projection, task execution, status, and monitor architecture. | Updated | Corrected focus ownership and promoted exact projection authority/atomic inspection, recovery, and dual-status rules. |
| `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/task-agent-monitor-visibility/autobyteus-web/docs/agent_teams.md` | Canonical Agent Team focus, reopen/hydration, transient task execution, and status behavior. | Updated | Added mounted/fresh exact projection semantics, failure atomicity, fallback reconciliation, and lifecycle/execution separation. |
| `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/task-agent-monitor-visibility/autobyteus-web/docs/settings.md` | Long-lived frontend settings guide also carries the shared Workspace execution-tree/runtime contract. | Updated | Synchronized its duplicated focus, hydration, recovery, and task-status guidance so it does not preserve the superseded split-focus model. |
| `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/task-agent-monitor-visibility/autobyteus-web/README.md` | Canonical frontend commands and browser-probe operations. | Updated | API/E2E added the named durable probe, covered production surfaces, output arguments, browser selection, and owned cleanup. |
| `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/task-agent-monitor-visibility/autobyteus-web/ARCHITECTURE.md` | High-level architecture catalog and testing strategy. | No change | It already links the updated execution architecture and README testing guide; ticket-specific detail does not belong in the high-level index. |
| `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/task-agent-monitor-visibility/autobyteus-web/docs/workspace_layout.md` | Workspace ownership and side-surface layout contract. | No change | Responsive layout owners and Activity placement are unchanged; exact Team focus/hydration belongs in the execution/team docs. |
| `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/task-agent-monitor-visibility/autobyteus-server-ts/docs/modules/agent_team_execution.md` | Canonical backend task activation, event publication, root sequence, and Team WebSocket contract. | Updated | Added the prepared/releasing/live/aborted task-Agent durability gate, activation-before-frame ordering, FIFO/reentrant/exactly-once release, abort/disposal safety, and live continuation contract. |

## Docs Updated

| Doc Path | Type Of Update | What Changed | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/task-agent-monitor-visibility/autobyteus-web/docs/agent_execution_architecture.md` | Runtime architecture | Made execution-view focus authoritative; documented exact mounted/fresh projection hydration, composite revision guard, loading/error/true-empty states, snapshot invalidation, settlement fallback reconciliation, and independent textual task/execution states. | Preserve the corrected ownership/data-flow invariant and prevent false-empty or split-focus regressions. |
| `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/task-agent-monitor-visibility/autobyteus-web/docs/agent_teams.md` | Team execution contract | Added inspection-before-focus, exact projection requirements for fresh/mounted paths, error atomicity, recovery invalidation, repaired-fallback hydration, and non-inferred task lifecycle presentation. | Keep the Team user/runtime contract aligned with implemented behavior. |
| `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/task-agent-monitor-visibility/autobyteus-web/docs/settings.md` | Shared Workspace execution contract within Settings documentation | Replaced stale roster/history focus ownership with view-derived exact focus and added the same projection-authority, recovery, and lifecycle/execution rules. | Prevent the Settings guide from contradicting the canonical execution architecture. |
| `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/task-agent-monitor-visibility/autobyteus-web/README.md` | Operational test documentation | Added the self-starting task monitor browser probe, behavior boundary, command, output directory, browser override, and resource-cleanup guidance. | Make the durable regression coverage reproducible and discoverable. |
| `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/task-agent-monitor-visibility/autobyteus-web/package.json` | Operational command surface | Added `test:e2e:task-agent-monitor-visibility`. | Provide the documented stable entrypoint for the durable browser probe. |
| `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/task-agent-monitor-visibility/tickets/done/task-agent-monitor-visibility/release-notes.md` | Future release notes | Summarized exact task monitor hydration, coherent focus, dual statuses, and recovery improvements in user-facing terms. | Preserve curated release input before user verification and any later publication decision. |
| `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/task-agent-monitor-visibility/autobyteus-server-ts/docs/modules/agent_team_execution.md` | Cross-boundary runtime architecture | Documented the registry-owned task-Agent durability gate, activation visibility barrier, event release states/order, root sequence ownership, abort/disposal behavior, and root-stream continuation after first projection. | Preserve the corrected server egress invariant that DR-003 proved was missing. |
| `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/task-agent-monitor-visibility/autobyteus-web/docs/agent_execution_architecture.md` | Cross-boundary frontend runtime architecture | Added activation-before-exact-frame and exact-run live continuation semantics after guarded first-inspection hydration. | Make clear that projection hydration cannot replace later task-Agent stream delivery. |
| `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/task-agent-monitor-visibility/autobyteus-web/docs/agent_teams.md` | Team execution contract | Added task activation/event ordering, gate release/abort behavior, early-selected convergence, and repeated same-address isolation. | Keep the Team contract aligned with the corrected server/frontend path. |
| `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/task-agent-monitor-visibility/autobyteus-web/docs/settings.md` | Shared Workspace execution contract within Settings documentation | Synchronized its duplicated task-monitor contract with the corrected live-event egress and exact routing rules. | Prevent the Settings guide from preserving the incomplete projection-only model rejected by DR-003. |
| `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/task-agent-monitor-visibility/tickets/done/task-agent-monitor-visibility/release-notes.md` | Future release notes | Added no-reload live task progress and activation-before-frame ordering in user-facing terms. | Preserve corrected release input before renewed verification. |

## Durable Design / Runtime Knowledge Promoted

| Topic | What Future Readers Need To Understand | Source Ticket Artifact(s) | Target Long-Lived Doc |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Exact focus authority | `TeamExecutionViewState` owns the focused exact AgentRun; the run-history current row is a derived read model and is updated only after successful inspection. | Requirements R-001/R-002; design DS-001/DS-003; implementation handoff; `CRR-002` | `agent_execution_architecture.md`, `agent_teams.md`, `settings.md` |
| Retained projection authority | A mounted/live-created task context can still be an unauthoritative empty shell. Exact root/run projection hydration stages conversation and Activity and commits only after the context/revision witness still matches. | Requirements R-002/R-003; design DS-002/DS-005; implementation handoff; `API-REV-002` | `agent_execution_architecture.md`, `agent_teams.md`, `settings.md` |
| Recovery convergence | Snapshot/reconnect invalidates projection authority; settlement that repairs focus must immediately reconcile the fallback projection. | Requirements R-004; design DS-006; `IR-002`; `CRR-002`; API-E2E-TMV-002 | `agent_execution_architecture.md`, `agent_teams.md`, `settings.md` |
| Lifecycle versus execution | Task-record lifecycle and exact Agent execution status are independent visible text. Idle, ordinary handoff copy, conversation, or Activity never implies formal completion. | Requirements R-005–R-008; UI/UX spec; implementation handoff; API-E2E-TMV-001 | `agent_execution_architecture.md`, `agent_teams.md`, `settings.md` |
| Durable regression operation | The self-starting probe exercises exact task selection, snapshot invalidation, settlement fallback reconciliation, output capture, browser discovery, and owned cleanup. | Coverage investigation; execution coverage report; `CRR-004` | `README.md`, `package.json` |
| Task-Agent durability event gate | Pre-activation task-Agent events remain private; after durable activation and public `TASK_AGENT_ACTIVATED`, release drains FIFO including reentrant events, then forwards later exact events once. Abort/disposal publishes nothing and starts no work. | `SR-006`; DS-009; `IR-003`; `CRR-005`; API-E2E-GATE-001/002 | `autobyteus-server-ts/docs/modules/agent_team_execution.md` |
| Live early-selected convergence | First-inspection projection is a baseline; the root stream must subsequently advance exact selected conversation, Activity, and execution status without reload/refocus, with activation preceding exact frames and repeated same-address runs isolated. | R-013/AC-017; `DR-003`; `API-REV-003` | `agent_execution_architecture.md`, `agent_teams.md`, `settings.md`, server `agent_team_execution.md` |

## Removed / Replaced Components Recorded

| Old Component / Path / Concept | What Replaced It | Where The New Truth Is Documented |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Independently patched run-history focus (`applyRunNavigationTeamFocus`) | Navigation derives current focus from `TeamExecutionViewState` after successful exact inspection. | `agent_execution_architecture.md`, `agent_teams.md`, `settings.md` |
| Mounted-context existence treated as hydration success (`focusTeamMemberAndEnsureHydrated`) | Exact context-bound projection authority with single-flight staging and guarded commit. | `agent_execution_architecture.md`, `agent_teams.md`, `settings.md` |
| Clear-then-add projection Activity hydration | Pure Activity staging plus revision-checked atomic replacement. | `agent_execution_architecture.md` |
| Color/status-dot-only task interpretation | Visible Task marker plus separate lifecycle and execution text. | `agent_execution_architecture.md`, `agent_teams.md`, `settings.md` |
| Permanent enqueue-only task-Agent publisher callback | Registry-owned prepared/releasing/live/aborted durability event gate released after durable activation. | Server `agent_team_execution.md`; frontend execution/team/settings docs |

## No-Impact Decision (Use Only If Truly No Docs Changes Are Needed)

- Docs impact: N/A — durable docs changes were required and completed.
- Rationale: N/A.

## Delivery Continuation

- Current result: `Pass` for corrected integrated-state docs sync.
- Next delivery action: User acceptance and release authorization were received on 2026-09-01. Archive the ticket, finalize the repository into `personal`, release the next sequential patch `v1.4.64`, verify rollout, and record DR-005.
- Notes: Backend runtime documentation changed because IR-003 corrects event egress, but public DTO/schema, task persistence, lifecycle semantics, migration, compatibility, release-version, and deployment behavior remain unchanged. Existing retained data is directly usable without migration.

## DR-002 Local Electron Build Addendum

- Trigger: The user asked delivery to read the README and build Electron for hands-on testing.
- Additional long-lived docs impact: `No additional impact`.
- Rationale: The root/frontend READMEs and `autobyteus-web/docs/github-actions-tag-build.md` already document the applicable macOS command, integrated backend, `electron-dist` output, local no-notarization mode, and packaged terminal-runtime validation. Delivery used those instructions successfully without discovering a documentation mismatch.
- Delivery records updated: `handoff-summary.md`, `release-deployment-report.md`, `delivery-revision-record.md`, and `delivery-integrated-state-refresh.log` now record the local artifacts, validation, signing scope, and continued finalization hold.
- Result: `Pass`. Build evidence is in `delivery-electron-build.log`; integrity, architecture, packaged native runtime, and isolated bundled-server health evidence is in `delivery-electron-build-verification.log`.
- Documentation action: No additional canonical project-doc edit was made solely because of the local build.

## DR-003 Failed User Verification Addendum

- Trigger: User verification of the exact packaged Electron app failed against its embedded backend on the live-create/select-before-later-work boundary.
- Current docs state: The changed long-lived docs express the already-approved target behavior, including exact retained/live content, recovery convergence, truthful status, and Electron parity.
- Delivery interpretation: `Not release-ready`. The current implementation does not satisfy that documented contract in the verified packaged journey, so the DR-001 docs-sync pass is superseded for final delivery until corrected implementation and renewed API/E2E evidence agree with the docs.
- Documentation action now: No speculative canonical-doc rewrite. The failure is an implementation `Local Fix`, not a changed requirement. Re-run docs sync after the corrected candidate completes source review and refreshed API/E2E coverage; update the docs only if the actual correction changes durable mechanics.
- Evidence: `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/task-agent-monitor-visibility/tickets/done/task-agent-monitor-visibility/investigation-evidence/user-verification-electron-29695/`.
- Delivery result: `Blocked and rerouted`.

## DR-004 Corrected Candidate Re-entry Addendum

- Trigger: `SR-006` corrected the causal design, `IR-003` implemented the registry durability event gate, `CRR-005` passed source review, API-REV-003 passed the mandatory real root-socket/early-selected AC-017 journey at 97.9% confidence, and CRR-006 confirmed no durable test-code diff.
- Integrated-state result: `origin/personal` remains `80e2bd195c42ea3ced778dbc051d4d00edaef16f`; corrected candidate `fe9f1a286b37ce53d33999b1155bd189822a0a24` is ahead 3 / behind 0. No base commit entered the candidate.
- Docs impact: `Updated`. The prior frontend-only docs were incomplete after DR-003 proved the missing server egress edge. Canonical server and frontend execution docs now describe the complete gate/order/routing contract.
- Operational docs decision: `autobyteus-web/README.md` and `package.json` require no DR-004 edit. API-REV-003 intentionally left no durable coverage code; its corrected ticket-scoped real-backend probe and independent 8/8 DOM/projection rerun remain ticket evidence rather than a stable project command.
- Disclosure preserved: The mixed-task-delegation live Vitest emitted exact task frames but failed its unchanged stochastic worker-notification expectation and timed out in cleanup; it was not Pass evidence and its temporary edit was reverted. The ticket probe's original `task`/`task_agent` aggregate mismatch remains inspectable; the corrected ticket probe and independent 8/8 real DOM/projection isolation rerun are the valid evidence.
- Result: `Pass — ready for renewed user verification after corrected local package preparation`.

## Blocked Or Escalated Follow-Up (Use Only If Docs Sync Cannot Complete)

- Classification: N/A
- Recommended recipient: N/A
- Why docs could not be finalized truthfully: N/A

## DR-005 Finalization And Release Addendum

- Trigger: User accepted DR-004, declared the task done, and requested finalization plus a new release.
- Archive result: Ticket moved to `tickets/done/task-agent-monitor-visibility/` before ticket commit `973349c7db73489d1d99088b689067d706ce3fb0`.
- Target result: Merge commit `f87749dd4004d970d050c2ef9da7646786b8abbc` pushed to `origin/personal`.
- Release-doc result: Archived `release-notes.md` was synchronized by the documented helper to `.github/release-notes/release-notes.md`; web/gateway versions and the managed messaging manifest were updated by release commit `47b2a8629bc4e1551381711183f7104265a4a3f0` for `v1.4.64`.
- Additional long-lived technical-doc impact: `No`. The accepted implementation and durable runtime contract did not change after DR-004 docs sync.
- Publication result: `Pass`. The public v1.4.64 release and all five release workflows succeeded.
- Cleanup state: Final documentation and release records are complete. Physical worktree/branch cleanup remains held until the user quits the DR-004 AutoByteus app still running from the ticket worktree.
