## Revision Entries

### IR-001 — Exact task monitor projection authority baseline

- Triggering role, report path, and round: `architecture_reviewer`; `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/task-agent-monitor-visibility/tickets/done/task-agent-monitor-visibility/design-review-report.md`; `ARCH-REV-005` Pass.
- Triggering finding IDs: `N/A` for the initial baseline. `ARCH-F-006`/`MP-006` were resolved upstream before implementation resumed.
- Classification: `Initial Baseline`
- Prior authoritative result: `N/A`
- Current authoritative result: frontend implementation is complete and ready for code review. Mounted and fresh Team paths establish exact retained-projection authority before focus/selection, task presentation is truthful, standalone Agent open policy is preserved, and superseded production writers/focus actions are removed.
- Related solution revision IDs: `SR-005`
- Related architecture-review revision IDs: `ARCH-REV-005`
- Related code-review revision IDs: `N/A`
- Related API/E2E revision IDs: `N/A`
- Related delivery revision IDs: `N/A`
- Why this baseline or implementation revision is recorded: establish the initial code-review handoff after the reviewed deterministic reproduction corrected the authority invariant from “live local state is sufficient” to explicit exact-projection staging, validation, and guarded commit.
- Approved behavior or requirement IDs affected: BEH-001–BEH-006; PB-001; R-001–R-011; AC-001–AC-015; DS-001–DS-008.
- Implementation delta: added context-bound projection authority and single-flight mounted hydration; added exact required-focus fresh hydration with all-or-none Activity commit; made Activity replacement revisioned/atomic; derived navigation from Team view focus; added stream freshness invalidation and non-stealing activation; preserved standalone keep-live/replacement ordering; added task lifecycle/execution presentation, loading/error/retry/empty states, accessibility, and localization; removed obsolete production hydration/status/focus paths.
- Changed files or areas: `autobyteus-web/services/runHydration/**`, `services/runOpen/**`, `services/teamExecution/**`, `services/agentStreaming/TeamStreamingService.ts`, Activity/run-history/Team stores, Team/history/mobile UI, localization catalogs, and focused unit/integration specs. No `autobyteus-server-ts/**` file changed.
- Local validation and result: 27 changed spec files / 257 tests passed; focused mapper follow-up 5/5 passed; Nuxt production build passed; browser feedback loop against node 8001 passed exact identity/content/status/responsive assertions; full suite passed 2,432 tests with one unrelated existing typography-audit failure; standard typecheck is toolchain-blocked, while direct TypeScript filtering found zero changed-production diagnostics; diff/backend/removal/size guards passed.
- Next recipient or routing: `/code_reviewer` with the cumulative package and implementation evidence.
- Remaining limitations or risks: independent API/E2E coverage investigation/execution is pending; one durable E2E fixture still calls the removed focus action and requires downstream coverage disposition; the broad suite retains one unrelated fixed-pixel audit failure; Nuxt typecheck entrypoint is blocked by the installed `vue-tsc`/TypeScript package-export mismatch.

### IR-002 — Reconcile projection after settlement focus repair

- Triggering role, report path, and round: `code_reviewer`; `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/task-agent-monitor-visibility/tickets/done/task-agent-monitor-visibility/code-review-report.md`; implementation review round 1 / `CRR-001`.
- Triggering finding IDs: `CR-F-001` / `CR-MP-001`
- Classification: `Local Fix`
- Prior authoritative result: `IR-001` implementation; `CRR-001` Fail because incremental `TASK_EXECUTION_SETTLED` repaired focus but emitted navigation reconciliation only.
- Current authoritative result: when incremental settlement removes the focused execution and `repairFocus()` changes the exact focused AgentRun, `TeamExecutionViewState` emits `reconcile_focused_team_member_projection` after navigation reconciliation. `TeamStreamingService` consumes that existing effect with the repaired root/run IDs, entering the existing row-scoped loading/error-capable reconciliation action.
- Related solution revision IDs: `SR-005`
- Related architecture-review revision IDs: `ARCH-REV-005`
- Related code-review revision IDs: `CRR-001`
- Related API/E2E revision IDs: `N/A`
- Related delivery revision IDs: `N/A`
- Why this baseline or implementation revision is recorded: close the reachable reconnect-snapshot → focused-task settlement → fallback-focus convergence gap without changing requirements, ownership, APIs, or backend lifecycle.
- Approved behavior or requirement IDs affected: BEH-002–BEH-003; R-003–R-004; AC-009; DS-003/DS-006.
- Implementation delta: capture the exact focused AgentRun before task-event focus repair; after a `TASK_EXECUTION_SETTLED` repair, emit focused projection reconciliation only when the exact focus changed. Strengthen the view test to require the effect and add a stream test requiring reconciliation of the repaired coordinator.
- Changed files or areas: `autobyteus-web/services/teamExecution/teamExecutionViewState.ts`; `autobyteus-web/services/teamExecution/__tests__/teamExecutionViewState.spec.ts`; `autobyteus-web/services/agentStreaming/__tests__/TeamStreamingService.spec.ts`; current implementation handoff/revision artifacts; `CRR-001` review artifacts included in the cumulative package.
- Local validation and result: focused view/stream specs passed, 2 files / 22 tests; Nuxt production build passed; direct TypeScript fallback retained 465 repository-baseline diagnostics and reported zero diagnostics in changed production files; diff/backend/size guards passed.
- Next recipient or routing: `/code_reviewer` for full source re-review before API/E2E.
- Remaining limitations or risks: independent API/E2E remains pending; durable E2E fixture disposition, unrelated typography audit failure, and the Nuxt typecheck toolchain limitation remain unchanged from IR-001.

### IR-003 — Restore post-durability task-Agent event egress

- Triggering role, report path, and round: `/delivery_engineer`; `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/task-agent-monitor-visibility/tickets/done/task-agent-monitor-visibility/delivery-revision-record.md`; `DR-003` packaged-user-verification reroute, followed by `/architecture_reviewer`; `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/task-agent-monitor-visibility/tickets/done/task-agent-monitor-visibility/design-review-report.md`; `ARCH-REV-006` Pass for `SR-006`.
- Triggering finding IDs: `USER-VERIFY-001`, investigation `F-018`–`F-021`, and material premise `MP-007`; no unresolved architecture finding.
- Classification: `Local Fix`
- Prior authoritative result: candidate `3064b084c` had historical source/durable-test/API-E2E passes, but `DR-003` blocked delivery after the packaged Electron app showed live-created exact task Agents as `In progress · Offline` with assignment-only monitors despite later retained work. `SR-006` proved the immutable enqueue-only task-Agent publisher callback as the cause.
- Current authoritative result: the mixed task-Agent registry now owns one prepared/releasing/live/aborted publisher gate. It withholds before activation release, drains FIFO including synchronous reentrant events, becomes live only when empty, forwards every later event to the unchanged root publisher, and drops/prevents work on abort or disposal. The cumulative candidate is ready for source re-review before refreshed API/E2E.
- Related solution revision IDs: `SR-006`
- Related architecture-review revision IDs: `ARCH-REV-006`
- Related code-review revision IDs: `CRR-001`–`CRR-004` are historical; current re-review pending
- Related API/E2E revision IDs: `API-REV-001`, `API-REV-002` are historical and superseded for delivery readiness
- Related delivery revision IDs: `DR-003`
- Why this baseline or implementation revision is recorded: close the source-proven missing post-durability event edge without weakening the already-reviewed frontend first-inspection/recovery safeguards or changing root sequencing, DTOs, task semantics, persistence, or lifecycle.
- Approved behavior or requirement IDs affected: BEH-001–BEH-002, BEH-005–BEH-007; PB-002; R-004, R-007–R-008, R-013; AC-002–AC-003, AC-008, AC-014, AC-017; DS-009.
- Implementation delta: replace the permanent `retainedEvents.push` callback plus one-shot detached drain with `TaskAgentDurabilityEventGate`; keep gates registered through committed-but-unreleased state so registry disposal aborts them; make release state-aware and boolean; delete the gate only after a successful transition to live; queue assignment work only after successful release; preserve the existing task service's durable activation → activation publication → release order.
- Changed files or areas: `autobyteus-server-ts/src/agent-team-execution/backends/mixed/members/mixed-task-agent-execution-registry.ts`; `autobyteus-server-ts/tests/unit/agent-team-execution/mixed-team-member-registry-task-agent-memory.test.ts`; current implementation handoff/revision artifacts. Existing frontend candidate remains unchanged by `IR-003`.
- Local validation and result: combined registry/task-delegation owner-unit run passed 2 files / 12 tests; production-source TypeScript build configuration passed with `--noEmit`; changed diff check and 225-effective-line source guard passed. The standard server typecheck remains baseline-blocked by `tests` being included under `rootDir: src` and reports TS6059 across the test tree.
- Next recipient or routing: `/code_reviewer` for full source re-review. After Pass, `/api_e2e_engineer` must refresh coverage investigation/execution for the actual root Team socket and real-backend AC-017 early-selection journey.
- Remaining limitations or risks: implementation did not run API/E2E, a live LLM task, real-backend browser convergence, or packaged Electron. Historical API/E2E did not cover the failed real transport boundary and is not current delivery-readiness evidence. Any downstream durable coverage edit must return through proportional code review. Delivery must re-confirm the actual `origin/personal` integration target because the SR-006 request mentioned nonexistent `origin/main`.
