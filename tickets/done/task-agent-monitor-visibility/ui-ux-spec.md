# UI/UX Specification

## Status (`Draft`/`Requirements-ready`/`Refined`)

`Refined` — observable UI behavior remains user-approved. SR-006 corrects the technical dependency: one bounded server task-Agent event-egress defect is in scope because it prevents the existing live monitor contract from reaching the frontend; Agent prompts, LLM/tool choice, task policy, persistence, and lifecycle behavior remain unchanged.

## UX Goal

Make a delegated task Agent inspectable and understandable at a glance. When a user selects a `Task:` row, every workspace surface must visibly switch to authoritative state for that exact task execution and must say both what is happening in the formal task workflow and what the Agent execution is doing now. The UI must never style the task child as current while silently showing either the configured parent or an unhydrated exact-task shell, and it must distinguish loading/error from a genuinely empty task history.

## Related Requirements And Acceptance Criteria

- Requirements: R-001–R-011 and R-013, including R-007–R-008 lifecycle-independent exact-content visibility and R-013 post-durability task-Agent event egress.
- Acceptance criteria: AC-001–AC-015 and AC-017, including AC-008/AC-012–AC-014 for lifecycle/tool-choice-independent rendering and AC-017 for real-backend live convergence.
- These IDs add no manual submission control and authorize no prompt, tool, task-policy, persistence, lifecycle, public-DTO, or presentation-contract change. The only server authorization is the proven registry event-gate correction.

## Users / Personas / Contexts

- Department/team operator monitoring delegated work in a long-lived Electron window.
- Agent/team builder checking whether a dedicated task assignee is working, waiting, failed, or ready for review.
- Browser-based operator using the web-equivalent frontend against a configured Docker/remote node.
- Keyboard and assistive-technology user navigating the execution tree and monitor.

## Journey Details

### UXJ-001 — Select an exact task in an already-open Team

1. The user expands the existing Team hierarchy and finds a transient `Task: <description prefix>` child beneath the configured Agent placement.
2. The user selects the task row by pointer, Enter, or Space.
3. If the task monitor projection is already authoritative locally, selection commits immediately. Otherwise the target row exposes an in-progress loading treatment while the currently selected workspace remains coherent.
4. On success, the task row becomes the sole current row and the header, center event monitor, Activity pane, and existing focus-dependent tabs resolve the same exact task AgentRun.
5. The header visibly identifies `Task`, retains the logical Agent name, displays the execution state, and makes the full task description discoverable.
6. The task row displays formal lifecycle and execution status together.

### UXJ-002 — Compare configured parent and task child

1. Selecting the configured parent renders its own header/status/monitor, even when it is `Offline` with no recorded Activity.
2. Selecting the task child renders the task run's status and retained work, even though both display the logical name `prototype_bootstrapper`.
3. Returning to the parent restores only the parent context. No monitor content/status is copied or cached under the wrong identity.

### UXJ-003 — Load, recover, or confirm empty

1. Selection begins exact task projection loading.
2. The row remains keyboard focused but is not marked `aria-current` until the exact focus transaction succeeds.
3. Success merges retained projection content with newer live events and commits selection once.
4. If authoritative content is truly empty, the monitor states `No activity recorded for this task yet.`
5. If loading fails or identity validation fails, the previous execution remains current. An inline error announces the failure and exposes `Retry`; retry repeats the exact task selection/hydration operation.

### UXJ-004 — Interpret dual status

- `In progress · Running`: the task is formally assigned and the Agent is generating/executing.
- `In progress · Idle`: the task is still formally active but the Agent is between turns or has stopped generating; this is not completion.
- `Awaiting review · Idle`: the assignee formally submitted a result and the delegator has not yet decided.
- `Revision requested · Running/Idle`: formal review requested another result; execution status says whether work is happening now.
- `Accepted` / `Interrupted`: terminal lifecycle wording appears wherever the settled task is represented in task history or historical execution inspection. Existing live-tree settlement behavior remains intact.

### UXJ-006 — Live topology changes

- Activation inserts/updates the task row but keeps the user's current exact selection.
- Snapshot/reconnect rebuilds topology and reuses the exact focused AgentRun when still visible.
- Settlement of a nonfocused task only removes/updates that task representation.
- Settlement of the focused task invokes existing valid fallback selection; the tree, header, monitor, and Activity switch together.

### UXJ-007 — Observe task work after early selection

1. A configured Agent delegates directly to another configured Agent in the same nested Team.
2. The root Team stream inserts the exact task row after durable activation; the user selects it while only the assignment snapshot is present.
3. The selected row/header/monitor may initially show the authoritative assignment snapshot and transitional execution status.
4. Without reload, refocus, projection polling, or a formal task transition, exact task-Agent status/turn/content/tool events arriving on the existing root Team stream update the selected header, monitor, and Activity pane.
5. When the Agent becomes idle, the UI shows the current execution status and all delivered work while the formal lifecycle independently remains truthful.

## Interaction And State-Transition Specification

| Scenario / State | User Action Or Trigger | Immediate Feedback | Resulting UI State | Data / Side Effect | Next Available Actions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Task projection already authoritative | Select task row | Standard pressed/focus feedback | Task becomes sole current row; all surfaces switch together | Exact focus commits; no network fetch required | inspect, change tabs/selection |
| Task projection missing/incomplete | Select task row | Row indicates loading; previous workspace stays rendered/current | On success, task becomes current and exact content appears | Fetch/validate/merge exact projection, then commit focus | inspect |
| Projection fetch/validation fails | Select task or retry | Error announced; loading stops | Previous row remains current; target is not current | No partial focus/selected-member commit | Retry or select another row |
| Live task activation | Stream event | New task row appears without selected styling | Existing selected workspace remains unchanged | Topology reconciles; no focus theft | select new task when desired |
| Early-selected task produces later work | Exact task-Agent stream events | Existing selected monitor/status advance incrementally | Conversation/Activity/status converge for the same exact run without reload | Existing root Team WebSocket dispatch; no polling or lifecycle inference | continue monitoring or change selection |
| Live snapshot/recovery | Stream checkpoint/snapshot | Existing recovery notice behavior if needed | Exact focus preserved if still visible; otherwise one fallback becomes current | Context/topology replace and focus reconcile atomically | continue or select another row |
| Task submission event | Formal `submit_task_result` succeeds | Lifecycle text updates | `Awaiting review · <execution>` shown while execution remains represented | Existing task record update/state transition | delegator reviews formally |
| Task settlement | Accepted/interrupted settlement event | Affected live task leaves or updates per existing tree policy | Nonfocused selection unchanged; focused task repairs to one coherent fallback | Existing settlement state/tree transition | inspect task history or another run |

## Markdown Wireframes / Visual Structure

### Execution tree: configured parent plus task

```text
●  prototype_bootstrapper                              Offline
   └─ Task: Outcome: Baseline Needed…
      In progress · Idle
```

The task retains the established transient indentation/border/selection treatment. Status becomes visible text rather than only a dot. On constrained width, the task description truncates first; the lifecycle/execution line remains readable or has an accessible full label.

### Selected task header

```text
[P]  prototype_bootstrapper  [Task]  Idle
     Outcome: Baseline Needed…
```

- `Task` is a compact visible badge/marker.
- `Idle` is the existing Agent execution status.
- The task description may be a compact secondary line or accessible title/label; it must not expose `taskId` or `agentRunId`.
- Formal lifecycle remains visible in the task row and may also appear near the task description when layout permits; one authoritative label source drives both.

### Selection loading without false switch

```text
Task: Outcome: Baseline Needed…
Loading task activity…

[previous exact member monitor remains coherent]
```

### Recoverable error

```text
Couldn't load task activity.  [Retry]
```

### True empty task monitor

```text
No activity recorded for this task yet.
```

## Non-Happy-Path States

### Loading

- Use `Loading task activity…` (localized equivalent) during required exact projection hydration.
- Loading must not clear the prior monitor, show the target as current, or momentarily render the target's empty context as authoritative.
- Expose busy state on the selecting task row/operation; preserve keyboard focus.

### Empty

- Only after successful authoritative hydration and reconciliation may an empty task show `No activity recorded for this task yet.`
- A configured parent's existing generic empty wording may remain when that configured parent is actually selected.
- Zero events must not be used as proof that a task is not working or completed.

### Error And Recovery

- Exact projection/identity failure: `Couldn't load task activity. Retry` (localized equivalent).
- Keep the previous coherent exact selection and its monitor; never combine previous content with target current-row styling.
- `Retry` reuses the exact same selection transaction and is keyboard accessible.
- Existing Team stream recovery notice remains the recovery surface for stream checkpoint/gap failures; after recovery, focus/topology must converge.

### Disabled / Unavailable

- Nonfocusable task-Team container rows retain disclosure-only behavior; their member Agent rows remain the focus targets.
- Settled task executions absent from live navigation are not selectable there; they remain inspectable through existing task history/historical surfaces where supported.
- A task Agent row with an unavailable exact execution must not be rendered as focusable current content.

### Permission / Authentication

- No new permission or authentication state. Existing Team/run access and exact task authorization apply.
- Internal IDs remain hidden from ordinary labels while still governing selection internally.

## Responsive And Platform Behavior

- The behavior and labels must match in the Electron renderer and ordinary browser-equivalent frontend against embedded and configured nodes.
- Primary validation viewport follows the supplied desktop workspace. At narrower supported desktop widths, description text truncates before lifecycle/execution meaning is lost.
- This ticket does not redesign mobile navigation; any existing surface that presents the same task row/header must still consume the same exact-focus/status state rather than inventing a parallel interpretation.
- Honor `prefers-reduced-motion`; no new motion is required.

## Accessibility And Keyboard Behavior

- Task rows remain `role="treeitem"`; pointer, Enter, and Space invoke the same atomic selection operation.
- Exactly one visible Agent execution row in the selected Team exposes `aria-current="true"` after successful selection.
- A loading target exposes busy/loading semantics but not current selection.
- Accessible row name includes full task description, task role, formal lifecycle, Agent execution status, logical address, and tree level; it does not expose internal IDs.
- Status meaning must be present in text; color/status dots are supplementary.
- Error uses an announced alert/status pattern, and Retry has an explicit accessible label.
- Existing visible focus rings and tree-level semantics remain.

## Content, Labels, And Validation Messages

| Meaning | Required English source label |
| --- | --- |
| Task marker | `Task` |
| Active lifecycle | `In progress` |
| Submitted lifecycle | `Awaiting review` |
| Revision lifecycle | `Revision requested` |
| Accepted lifecycle | `Accepted` |
| Interrupted lifecycle | `Interrupted` |
| Combined compact status | `<Lifecycle> · <Execution status>` |
| Projection loading | `Loading task activity…` |
| Projection error | `Couldn't load task activity.` |
| Recovery action | `Retry` |
| Authoritative task empty | `No activity recorded for this task yet.` |

Use localization keys for all new visible/accessible copy. Do not use `Complete` for `Idle`, `Awaiting review`, or an ordinary completion message.

## Data And API Dependencies

- Exact focused AgentRun: owning `AgentTeamContext.view` focus state.
- Row lifecycle/execution values: existing projected `taskStatus` and `currentStatus`.
- Retained monitor: existing `GetTeamMemberRunProjection(teamRunId, agentRunId)` response.
- Live monitor/status: existing root Team execution WebSocket and per-Agent dispatch. The server registry durability gate must forward buffered and all later exact task-Agent Agent events into that existing publisher after `TASK_AGENT_ACTIVATED`; GraphQL hydration is retained-state recovery/first inspection, not a polling substitute.
- Formal lifecycle: existing task delegation record and `TASK_DELEGATION_EVENT` updates.
- Task context: existing task description/record associated to the exact task execution; no new public ID display.

## Out Of Scope

- New manual task submit/review buttons in this workspace.
- Full visual redesign of Team task history, Activity, Token, Artifacts, or the navigation hierarchy.
- Automatically selecting new tasks, inferring completion, or displaying internal IDs.
- Mobile-specific information architecture changes.
- Agent prompt/tool-choice behavior, task submission/review policy, persistence/lifecycle transitions, new public event DTOs, or a second live transport.

## Open Decisions / Risks

- Design must choose the smallest established header layout that keeps the `Task` marker and description discoverable without crowding existing actions. The required information hierarchy is authoritative; exact spacing/token choice is implementation-level.
- The clean-baseline node-8001 experiment deterministically proves the first-inspection false-empty shell: both focus IDs are exact, but selection performs no exact projection query. The SR-006 packaged/current-source experiment independently selected the exact task immediately, then observed backend projection growth from 1/1 to 6/4 while the UI stayed `Offline`/1/1 and the healthy root socket delivered zero exact task-Agent Agent frames. Coverage must encode both independently supported paths and validate snapshot/recovery/fresh-open boundaries that share hydration/convergence code.
- The registry event gate is a transport dependency, not a new UI state. Its ordering contract (`TASK_AGENT_ACTIVATED` before exact Agent events; later events exactly once/in order) must be proven with a real backend because intercepted frontend fixtures can mask the missing edge.

## Approval Status

Initially approved on 2026-08-31 and refined by the user's explicit scope clarification the same day. SR-006 changes no requested layout or interaction; it corrects the proven production dependency after the user rejected the earlier frontend-only causal design. The authoritative UI scope confirms:

1. task rows show visible `formal lifecycle · Agent execution` status;
2. the selected header shows a `Task` marker and exact task context;
3. selection does not switch current-row state until exact hydration succeeds; and
4. new task activation does not steal the user's focus; and
5. exact task messages/Activity remain visible regardless of LLM collaboration-tool choice, without changing prompts or backend lifecycle behavior; and
6. an early-selected exact task continues advancing from existing root Team stream events without reload/refocus.
