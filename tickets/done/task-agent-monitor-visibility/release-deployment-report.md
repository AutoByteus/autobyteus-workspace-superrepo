# Delivery / Release / Deployment Report

## Release / Publication / Deployment Scope

The user explicitly accepted the corrected candidate on 2026-09-01, declared the task done, and requested finalization plus a new release. Repository finalization and the next sequential patch release, `v1.4.64`, completed successfully. All five tag-triggered release workflows passed and the public GitHub release contains the expected desktop, Android, messaging-gateway, and update-metadata assets. Final handoff remains held only for safe local cleanup because the user-owned DR-004 AutoByteus app is still running from the ticket worktree.

## Handoff Summary

- Handoff summary artifact: `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/task-agent-monitor-visibility/tickets/done/task-agent-monitor-visibility/handoff-summary.md`
- Handoff summary status: `Updated`
- Delivery revision record: `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/task-agent-monitor-visibility/tickets/done/task-agent-monitor-visibility/delivery-revision-record.md`
- Current delivery revision ID: `DR-005`
- Notes: DR-003 remains the rejected-package history; DR-004 remains the corrected verification-package result; DR-005 records user acceptance, repository finalization, v1.4.64 publication, rollout success, and the remaining safe-cleanup hold.

## Initial Delivery Integration Refresh

- Bootstrap base reference: `origin/personal` at `80e2bd195c42ea3ced778dbc051d4d00edaef16f`
- Latest tracked remote base checked after acceptance: `origin/personal` at `80e2bd195c42ea3ced778dbc051d4d00edaef16f`
- Base advanced since DR-004: `No`
- New base commits integrated into the ticket branch: `No`
- Local checkpoint commit result: `Not needed`
- Integration method: `Already current`
- Integration result: `Completed`
- Post-integration executable checks rerun: `Yes`
- Post-integration verification result: `Passed`
- Checks: finalization owner-unit rerun passed 2 files / 12 tests; named browser probe syntax/script-target guards passed; source/docs scoped whitespace validation passed. Raw archived execution logs retain tool-emitted whitespace and were excluded from the scoped whitespace guard without altering their evidence.
- Evidence: `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/task-agent-monitor-visibility/tickets/done/task-agent-monitor-visibility/delivery-integrated-state-refresh.log`, `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/task-agent-monitor-visibility/tickets/done/task-agent-monitor-visibility/delivery-finalization-owner-unit.log`, and `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/task-agent-monitor-visibility/tickets/done/task-agent-monitor-visibility/docs-sync-validation.log`.
- Delivery edits started only after integrated state was current: `Yes`
- Handoff state current with latest tracked remote base: `Yes`
- Blocker: N/A

## User Verification

- Initial explicit verification received: `Yes — DR-003 failed and was rerouted.`
- Renewed corrected-candidate verification received: `Yes`
- Acceptance reference: User message on 2026-09-01: “the task is done. lets finalize and release a new version”.
- Renewed verification required after finalization refresh: `No`; the tracked base had not advanced and the accepted user-facing candidate did not change.

## Docs Sync Result

- Docs sync artifact: `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/task-agent-monitor-visibility/tickets/done/task-agent-monitor-visibility/docs-sync-report.md`
- Docs sync result: `Updated`
- Canonical docs updated: server Team execution, frontend execution architecture, Agent Teams, Settings, and curated release notes.
- README/package DR-004 decision: No extra durable test command/fixture change because API-REV-003 left no repository-resident durable coverage diff.

## Ticket State Transition

- Ticket moved to `tickets/done/task-agent-monitor-visibility`: `Yes`
- Archived ticket path: `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/task-agent-monitor-visibility/tickets/done/task-agent-monitor-visibility`
- Archive commit: `973349c7db73489d1d99088b689067d706ce3fb0`

## Version / Tag / Release Commit

- Previous version: `1.4.63`
- Released version: `1.4.64`
- Release commit: `47b2a8629bc4e1551381711183f7104265a4a3f0`
- Annotated tag: `v1.4.64`
- Tag target: `47b2a8629bc4e1551381711183f7104265a4a3f0`
- Versioned packages: `autobyteus-web` and `autobyteus-message-gateway` both `1.4.64`.
- Managed messaging manifest: synchronized to `v1.4.64` / artifact version `1.4.64`.

## Repository Finalization

- Bootstrap context source: `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/task-agent-monitor-visibility/tickets/done/task-agent-monitor-visibility/investigation-notes.md`
- Ticket branch: `codex/task-agent-monitor-visibility`
- Ticket branch commit result: `Completed` at `973349c7db73489d1d99088b689067d706ce3fb0`
- Ticket branch push result: `Completed`
- Finalization target remote/branch: `origin/personal`
- Target advanced after acceptance: `No`
- Delivery-owned edits protected before re-integration: `Not needed`; base unchanged.
- Re-integration before final merge result: `Completed` through a clean isolated delivery worktree.
- Target merge commit: `f87749dd4004d970d050c2ef9da7646786b8abbc`
- Target branch push result: `Completed`
- Repository finalization status: `Completed`
- Worktree isolation disclosure: The primary `personal` worktree was 37 commits behind at the start and contained non-owned `package.json` changes plus untracked outputs. Delivery did not stash, reset, or overwrite it. A clean temporary delivery branch/worktree based on exact `origin/personal` performed the merge and safe `HEAD:personal` pushes.
- Blocker: N/A

## Release / Publication / Deployment

- Applicable: `Yes`
- Method: `Release Script`
- Documented helper: `pnpm release 1.4.64 -- --release-notes tickets/done/task-agent-monitor-visibility/release-notes.md`
- Safe isolated invocation: the same helper with `--branch delivery/task-agent-monitor-visibility-finalize-v1.4.64 --no-push`, followed by explicit fast-forward `HEAD:personal` and `v1.4.64` tag pushes because the occupied primary `personal` worktree could not be modified safely.
- Release/publication/deployment result: `Completed`
- Release notes handoff result: `Used`
- Public release: `https://github.com/AutoByteus/autobyteus-workspace/releases/tag/v1.4.64`
- Release verification artifact: `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/task-agent-monitor-visibility/tickets/done/task-agent-monitor-visibility/delivery-release-v1.4.64-verification.json`
- Published release assets: 21 assets, including macOS ARM64/x64 DMG+ZIP, Linux ARM64/x64 AppImage, Windows EXE, Android APK, messaging-gateway archive/metadata/checksum, and updater metadata.
- Blocker: N/A

## Rollout Verification

All tag-triggered workflows completed successfully:

- Desktop Release: `https://github.com/AutoByteus/autobyteus-workspace/actions/runs/33464382092`
- Android APK Release: `https://github.com/AutoByteus/autobyteus-workspace/actions/runs/33464382035`
- iOS App Store Connect Release: `https://github.com/AutoByteus/autobyteus-workspace/actions/runs/33464382050`
- Release Messaging Gateway: `https://github.com/AutoByteus/autobyteus-workspace/actions/runs/33464382034`
- Server Docker Release: `https://github.com/AutoByteus/autobyteus-workspace/actions/runs/33464382031`

The public GitHub release is non-draft, non-prerelease, targets the release commit, and exposes the curated v1.4.64 artifacts. Remote `origin/personal` and annotated `v1.4.64` both resolve to release commit `47b2a8629bc4e1551381711183f7104265a4a3f0` before the post-release delivery-record commit.

## Post-Finalization Cleanup

- Dedicated ticket worktree: `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/task-agent-monitor-visibility`
- Ticket worktree cleanup result: `Blocked for safety`
- Worktree prune result: `Completed` after temporary finalization-worktree removal
- Local ticket branch cleanup result: `Blocked` while its worktree hosts the running app
- Remote ticket branch cleanup result: `Completed`
- Temporary finalization worktree/branch cleanup result: `Completed`
- Safety blocker: The accepted DR-004 AutoByteus app root process and helpers are still running directly from ignored `electron-dist/dr004-fe9f1a/` inside the ticket worktree. Deleting that worktree would remove live executable/resources used by the current user-owned application session. Delivery will not terminate the application or delete its files without the user first quitting it.
- Generated-output disposition: Build-owned backend SDK output was already removed. Pre-existing non-owned contracts output remains only in the ticket worktree and will disappear with safe worktree cleanup.

## Escalation / Reroute

- Current classification: N/A
- Recommended recipient: N/A
- Notes: No source, design, requirement, review, API/E2E, release, or deployment issue remains. The only open action is user-coordinated local cleanup.

## Release Notes Summary

- Release notes artifact: `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/task-agent-monitor-visibility/tickets/done/task-agent-monitor-visibility/release-notes.md`
- Archived release notes used for publication: `Yes`
- Curated repository copy: `.github/release-notes/release-notes.md`
- Release notes status: `Published`

## Environment Or Persisted-Data Transition Notes

- Approved persisted-data decision: `Directly Usable — No Migration`
- Delivery action required: `None`
- Result: No public API/DTO/schema, compatibility, or persisted-data transition. The event gate changes task-Agent event publication ordering/forwarding only.

## Verification Checks

- User-accepted DR-004 Electron candidate.
- `CRR-005 Pass` at 9.42/10.
- `API-REV-003 Pass` at 97.9% final confidence with mandatory real-backend/root-socket/current-browser AC-017 proof.
- `CRR-006 Not Applicable` because API-REV-003 left no durable repository test diff.
- Finalization owner units: 2 files / 12 tests passed.
- Target merge identity, archive placement, probe syntax, package script target, release versions, managed manifest, remote branch/tag refs, GitHub release metadata/assets, and all five workflow conclusions passed.
- Preserved disclosures: the stochastic worker-notification failure/cleanup timeout was not Pass evidence; the corrected `task_agent` probe and independent 8/8 isolation rerun remain authoritative.

## Rollback Criteria

Revert the task commits and publish a follow-up patch if activation no longer precedes exact task frames, an already-open task monitor stops converging, exact same-address identities alias, or gate abort/disposal emits work. No data rollback is required. Do not move or retarget the published `v1.4.64` tag; use a new patch release for remediation.

## Final Status

`Repository finalization and v1.4.64 release: Pass. Final handoff cleanup: Blocked for safety until the user quits the DR-004 AutoByteus app.` No product or rollout defect is open.
