## Revision Entries

### ARCH-REV-001 — Frontend observability design needs hydration and open-path completion

- Canonical design review report: `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/task-agent-monitor-visibility/tickets/done/task-agent-monitor-visibility/design-review-report.md`
- Review round and trigger: Round 1; solution designer returned the user-refined frontend-only package under `SR-002` before any prior architecture-review result was completed.
- Triggering role, report path, and finding IDs: `/solution_designer`; no prior architecture-review report; user scope trigger `USER-SCOPE-001` recorded in `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/task-agent-monitor-visibility/tickets/done/task-agent-monitor-visibility/solution-revision-record.md`.
- Relevant solution revision IDs: `SR-001`, `SR-002` (`SR-002` authoritative)
- Prior authoritative decision: `N/A`
- Current authoritative decision: `Fail`
- What changed in the review result or what baseline was established: Established the first completed review baseline. The frontend ownership, derived-focus, stream-convergence, presentation, no-server-change, and no-migration directions are sound. Implementation is blocked because the proposed CAS does not witness Activity-only mutations that its apply clears, the atomic inspection path does not cover non-mounted/fresh Team open, and the revised package retains small current-scope documentation drift.

#### Prior Finding Resolution

None.

- New or remaining finding IDs: `ARCH-F-001`, `ARCH-F-002`, `ARCH-F-003`
- Material classification changes: Initial baseline; overall classification `Design Impact`. `MP-001` reconnect and `MP-002` activation-baseline premises are `Reachable` and justify their proposed mechanisms. `MP-003` Activity-only hydration race and `MP-004` non-mounted best-effort target failure are `Reachable` and block the current design.
- Recommended recipient: `/solution_designer`
- Remaining risks or uncertainty: Exact historical long-window sequence is not singularly reproduced, but supported activation/reconnect/fresh-open/failure paths are independently established. Continuous mutation may truthfully produce a recoverable error after the guard is completed. No prompt/server/lifecycle change is authorized.

### ARCH-REV-002 — Core hydration findings resolved; shared-adapter inventory remains incomplete

- Canonical design review report: `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/task-agent-monitor-visibility/tickets/done/task-agent-monitor-visibility/design-review-report.md`
- Review round and trigger: Round 2; solution designer returned `SR-003` as Design Impact rework for `ARCH-F-001`–`ARCH-F-003`.
- Triggering role, report path, and finding IDs: `/solution_designer`; prior canonical report at the path above; `ARCH-F-001`, `ARCH-F-002`, `ARCH-F-003`.
- Relevant solution revision IDs: `SR-001`, `SR-002`, `SR-003` (`SR-003` current; `SR-001` superseded)
- Prior authoritative decision: `Fail`
- Current authoritative decision: `Fail`
- What changed in the review result or what baseline was established: Verified that `SR-003` closes the Activity-only mounted-hydration race with a store-owned per-run revision and atomic batch, gives fresh/non-mounted selection an exact fail-fast target candidate, and completes the prior scope/supplement cleanup. The core frontend architecture now passes. Review remains failed because removal of the shared Activity writer is not mapped through three current production consumers, and one requirements cross-reference names undefined IDs.

#### Prior Finding Resolution

| Finding ID | Prior Status | Current Status | Related Revision References | Verification Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ARCH-F-001` | Open / High / Design Impact | Resolved | `SR-003`; `MP-003` | DS-002/DS-005 now capture exact Team/Agent contexts, `eventMonitorPresentationRevision`, and a store-owned per-run Activity-content revision; every content mutation/invalidation advances it; atomic replacement checks all revisions before any write and covers system-instruction/tool-only races. |
| `ARCH-F-002` | Open / High / Design Impact | Resolved | `SR-003`; `MP-004` | DS-001 and new DS-007 split mounted versus absent-root paths; required focus is resolved first, target projection is exact/fail-fast, nonfocus misses remain non-authoritative, and candidate validation/conflict handling precedes mount/selection/stream connect. |
| `ARCH-F-003` | Open / Low / Design Impact | Resolved | `SR-003` | Current investigation wording treats prompt/tool precedence as factual out-of-scope history only; `ui-ux-spec.md` and requirements supplement inventory align to R-001–R-011 and AC-001–AC-015; historical `SR-001` remains unchanged. |

- New or remaining finding IDs: `ARCH-F-004`, `ARCH-F-005`
- Material classification changes: `ARCH-F-001`–`ARCH-F-003` resolved. `MP-001`–`MP-004` remain `Reachable`, and the revised mechanisms they justify now pass the material-premise gate. New `ARCH-F-004` is `Design Impact`; new `ARCH-F-005` is `Unclear` documentation traceability.
- Recommended recipient: `/solution_designer`
- Remaining risks or uncertainty: Bounded retry exhaustion remains an approved recoverable outcome; exact historic sequence remains unknown but no longer drives speculative machinery. Activity writer exclusivity/read-only access is an implementation invariant. No server/prompt/lifecycle change is authorized.

### ARCH-REV-003 — Frontend observability design approved for implementation

- Canonical design review report: `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/task-agent-monitor-visibility/tickets/done/task-agent-monitor-visibility/design-review-report.md`
- Review round and trigger: Round 3; solution designer returned `SR-004` for `ARCH-F-004`–`ARCH-F-005`.
- Triggering role, report path, and finding IDs: `/solution_designer`; prior canonical report at the path above; `ARCH-F-004`, `ARCH-F-005`.
- Relevant solution revision IDs: `SR-001`–`SR-004` (`SR-004` current; `SR-001` superseded)
- Prior authoritative decision: `Fail`
- Current authoritative decision: `Pass`
- What changed in the review result or what baseline was established: Verified compile-complete disposition of the removed shared Activity writer, including staged standalone hydration/open through DS-008, keep-live preservation, guarded replacement, background caller ordering, deletion of the zero-production-caller helper, and adjacent coverage. Verified that current no-migration traceability uses only existing approved IDs. All prior findings are resolved and the material-premise gate passes.

#### Prior Finding Resolution

| Finding ID | Prior Status | Current Status | Related Revision References | Verification Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ARCH-F-004` | Open / Medium / Design Impact | Resolved | `SR-004`; `PB-001`; `DS-008`; `MP-005` | The final map and sequence disposition `runContextHydrationService.ts` and `agentRunOpenCoordinator.ts` through a pure `RunContextHydrationCandidate`, post-load strategy re-evaluation, keep-live without Activity replacement, Activity-first guarded replacement before selection/stream, and named unit/integration/caller-order tests. `teamRunMemberStatusHydration.ts` and stale mocks are removed after a repository-wide zero-production-caller audit; final import search gates completion. |
| `ARCH-F-005` | Open / Low / Unclear | Resolved | `SR-004` | Current requirements and design trace `Directly Usable — No Migration` to R-009 and AC-007/AC-013/AC-015. Undefined current R-012/AC-016 definitions/references are removed without adding behavior; historical `SR-001` remains unchanged. |

- New or remaining finding IDs: `None`
- Material classification changes: Review changes from `Fail` to `Pass`. `MP-001`–`MP-005` are `Reachable`; every dependent mechanism has a supported trigger and proportionate design response.
- Recommended recipient: `/implementation_engineer`
- Remaining risks or uncertainty: Continuous mounted contention or standalone context/Activity conflict may produce the designed recoverable failure while preserving prior coherent state. The singular historical long-window sequence remains unknown but does not drive unsupported machinery. Activity writer exclusivity/read-only access and the `autobyteus-server-ts/**` no-change guardrail remain implementation invariants.

### ARCH-REV-004 — Implementation readiness withdrawn pending deterministic reproduction

- Canonical design review report: `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/task-agent-monitor-visibility/tickets/done/task-agent-monitor-visibility/design-review-report.md`
- Review round and trigger: Round 4; `/solution_designer` reported the user's explicit requirement for deterministic live reproduction of the stale task-row/current-monitor contradiction against Docker node 8001 before progression and reopened investigation.
- Triggering role, report path, and finding IDs: `/solution_designer`; prior canonical report at the path above; new `ARCH-F-006`.
- Relevant solution revision IDs: `SR-001`–`SR-004`; a new solution revision is pending and `SR-004` is not final readiness authority.
- Prior authoritative decision: `Pass`
- Current authoritative decision: `Blocked`
- What changed in the review result or what baseline was established: The structural review completed in round 3 is not rewritten, but the user added an explicit evidence prerequisite. Existing artifacts prove the contradiction was observed and that fresh exact rendering works; they do not yet provide a deterministic supported initiating trigger and forward node-8001 execution path. Implementation readiness is withdrawn until that evidence and any resulting package changes are reviewed.

#### Prior Finding Resolution

| Finding ID | Prior Status | Current Status | Related Revision References | Verification Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ARCH-F-004` | Resolved | Remains Resolved | `SR-004`; `ARCH-REV-003` | No new evidence invalidates the shared-writer consumer disposition; final readiness is blocked for a different evidence prerequisite. |
| `ARCH-F-005` | Resolved | Remains Resolved | `SR-004`; `ARCH-REV-003` | Current no-migration traceability remains coherent; final readiness is blocked for a different evidence prerequisite. |

- New or remaining finding IDs: `ARCH-F-006`
- Material classification changes: Current decision changes from `Pass` to `Blocked`. New `MP-006` is `Unclear`; no downstream technical mechanism may establish its own deterministic production reachability.
- Recommended recipient: `/solution_designer`
- Remaining risks or uncertainty: The exact supported initiating event, lifecycle/mounted preconditions, and repeatable forward path to the stale visible state are unknown pending the reopened node-8001 experiment. No implementation or backend workaround is authorized meanwhile.

### ARCH-REV-005 — Deterministic live defect established; corrected frontend design approved

- Canonical design review report: `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/task-agent-monitor-visibility/tickets/done/task-agent-monitor-visibility/design-review-report.md`
- Review round and trigger: Round 5; `/solution_designer` returned `SR-005` with the user-required deterministic Docker node-8001 reproduction, exact browser/store/backend evidence, clean-baseline controls, and corrected activation-shell authority semantics.
- Triggering role, report path, and finding IDs: `/solution_designer`; prior canonical report at the path above; `ARCH-F-006` and `MP-006`.
- Relevant solution revision IDs: `SR-001`–`SR-005` (`SR-005` current; `SR-001` superseded)
- Prior authoritative decision: `Blocked`
- Current authoritative decision: `Pass`
- What changed in the review result or what baseline was established: Verified 3/3 reproduction through a supported normal user-to-nested-delegation flow on a clean detached frontend at `80e2bd195` against Docker node 8001. Exact backend conversation/Activity existed before selection, exact row/navigation/view/context identities aligned after click, the local context nevertheless remained `Offline`/0/0 through ten seconds, and selection made zero exact projection requests; a fresh-open control requested and rendered the exact projection. Verified the resulting design correction: activation/context materialization never establishes retained-projection authority; mounted exact inspection must stage, guard, and commit the exact projection before focus/current/outer selection. All adjacent mechanisms remain grounded in their independently reachable paths, and the frontend-only/no-migration/no-server boundaries remain intact.

#### Prior Finding Resolution

| Finding ID | Prior Status | Current Status | Related Revision References | Verification Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ARCH-F-006` | Open / High / Unclear | Resolved | `SR-005`; `MP-006` | `deterministic-reproduction-summary.json`, the repeatable probe, round-3 browser/store JSON and before/after PNGs, exact backend projection/topology, and the fresh-open control establish the supported trigger, initial mounted state, timing, exact identity, 3/3 contradiction, source path, and 1/1 control. The current design makes a live-created shell non-authoritative until guarded exact projection commit and preserves the previous coherent selection on failure. |

- New or remaining finding IDs: `None`
- Material classification changes: Decision changes from `Blocked` to `Pass`. `MP-006` changes from `Unclear` to `Reachable — reproduced 3/3`. `MP-002` remains reachable as an activation-order contract, but its prior consequence is corrected: activation before work does not establish retained-monitor projection authority, so the superseded live-baseline-authoritative design statement is rejected.
- Recommended recipient: `/implementation_engineer`
- Remaining risks or uncertainty: Bounded mounted contention or standalone context/Activity conflict may expose the designed recoverable failure while preserving prior coherent state. Activity revision completeness and the corrected non-authoritative activation-shell invariant require implementation review. Paused uncommitted frontend work predates `SR-005` and must be reconciled rather than used as evidence. No server/prompt/tool/lifecycle/persistence change is authorized.

### ARCH-REV-006 — Proven task-Agent event-egress correction approved

- Canonical design review report: `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/task-agent-monitor-visibility/tickets/done/task-agent-monitor-visibility/design-review-report.md`
- Review round and trigger: Round 6; user verification rejected the delivered Electron candidate, and `/solution_designer` returned `SR-006` after a current-source renderer plus packaged embedded-backend experiment isolated the missing post-durability task-Agent Agent-event edge.
- Triggering role, report path, and finding IDs: `/solution_designer`; prior canonical report at the path above; downstream `USER-VERIFY-001`, investigation F-018–F-021, and material premise `MP-007`. No new unresolved architecture finding is opened.
- Relevant solution revision IDs: `SR-001`–`SR-006` (`SR-006` current; `SR-001` superseded)
- Prior authoritative decision: `Pass` under `ARCH-REV-005`, subsequently superseded as an implementation-readiness basis by the failed packaged live journey.
- Current authoritative decision: `Pass`
- What changed in the review result or what baseline was established: Verified that MP-007 is independently reachable through a supported already-open configured-student_one to direct-task-student_two delegation. Exact selection loaded a valid 1/1 projection, the backend reached 6/4, the UI remained `Offline`/1/1 through +60 seconds, a healthy root socket delivered 227 frames but zero exact task-Agent Agent frames, and reconnect snapshot read the handle `Idle`. Current and packaged source establish the immutable enqueue-only publisher closure and one-shot drain as the causal boundary. Approved DS-009: the existing registry owns a prepared/releasing/live/aborted gate; activation publishes first, the gate drains buffered plus synchronous reentrant events FIFO, then later events forward exactly once to the unchanged root publisher. Prior frontend hydration/focus/Activity/presentation design remains independently required.

#### Prior Finding Resolution

| Finding ID | Prior Status | Current Status | Related Revision References | Verification Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ARCH-F-001`–`ARCH-F-005` | Resolved | Remain Resolved | `SR-003`–`SR-004`; `ARCH-REV-002`–`ARCH-REV-003` | The new server evidence does not invalidate the independently reachable Activity-race, fresh-target, shared-writer, scope, or traceability resolutions. |
| `ARCH-F-006` | Resolved | Remains Resolved | `SR-005`; `MP-006`; `ARCH-REV-005` | The delivered candidate's successful exact 1/1 selection confirms that first-inspection hydration remains necessary and functioning; MP-007 explains why later work still did not arrive. |

- New or remaining finding IDs: `None`
- Material classification changes: The prior frontend-only causal boundary is superseded, not the approved observable behavior. New `MP-007` is `Reachable — reproduced`; `BEH-007`, `PB-002`, R-013, AC-017, and DS-009 map its existing root-stream contract and proportionate correction. The material-premise gate remains `Pass` across MP-001–MP-007.
- Recommended recipient: `/implementation_engineer`
- Remaining risks or uncertainty: Implementation must prove FIFO/exactly-once behavior under synchronous reentrancy, abort/disposal/pre-durability isolation, idempotent release, and activation-before-exact-Agent-event root sequencing. The environment-gated server LLM E2E or an equivalent actual Team-socket path and a real-backend early-selected browser path are required before delivery. No poller, Team-message inference, DTO/projector, prompt/tool/task-policy/persistence/lifecycle change, or migration is authorized. The SR-006 request's `origin/main` label conflicts with the canonical/actual `origin/personal` remote; delivery must re-confirm the actual finalization target.
