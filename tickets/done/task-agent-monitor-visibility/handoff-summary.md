- Delivery status: `Repository finalization and v1.4.64 release completed; safe local cleanup pending user exit`.
- Current delivery revision: `DR-005`
- Worktree: `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/task-agent-monitor-visibility`
- Ticket branch: `codex/task-agent-monitor-visibility`
- Finalization target/base: `personal` / `origin/personal`
- Latest tracked base checked: `origin/personal` at `80e2bd195c42ea3ced778dbc051d4d00edaef16f`
- Corrected candidate HEAD: `fe9f1a286b37ce53d33999b1155bd189822a0a24`
- User completion/finalization authorization received: `Yes` on 2026-09-01; the user declared the task done and requested finalization plus a new release.

## Delivery Re-entry Integration Refresh

- `git fetch origin personal` passed on 2026-09-01 and left `origin/personal` at the recorded base `80e2bd195c42ea3ced778dbc051d4d00edaef16f`.
- `git rev-list --left-right --count HEAD...origin/personal` returned `3 0`; corrected candidate `fe9f1a286` is three commits ahead and zero base commits behind.
- Integration method: `Already current`; no checkpoint, merge, or rebase was needed.
- Post-integration executable rerun: No merge-induced rerun was required because no base code entered the candidate. API-REV-003 already validates the exact corrected commit, and delivery rebuilt/verified its packaged Electron artifact.

## DR-003 Failure History Preserved

- The original DR-002 package at `autobyteus-web/electron-dist/mac-arm64/AutoByteus.app` remains rejected.
- In the user's exact packaged journey, two live-created same-address task AgentRuns stayed `In progress · Offline` and assignment-only while their embedded-backend projections accumulated conversation, tool output, and Activity.
- SR-006 proved the missing edge was server task-Agent event egress: the direct task-Agent handle remained permanently bound to its pre-durability enqueue closure, so later exact Agent frames never reached the root Team stream.
- Failure evidence remains at `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/task-agent-monitor-visibility/tickets/done/task-agent-monitor-visibility/investigation-evidence/user-verification-electron-29695/`.
- DR-003 remains authoritative history; it is superseded for readiness only by the corrected implementation and evidence below.

## Corrected Behavior

- `MixedTaskAgentExecutionRegistry` now owns one prepared/releasing/live/aborted durability event gate per direct task Agent.
- Pre-activation events remain private. After durable activation and public `TASK_AGENT_ACTIVATED`, release drains FIFO, including synchronous reentrant events, then forwards later exact task-Agent events once through the unchanged root publisher.
- Assignment work starts only after release. Repeated release is idempotent; preparation failure, abort, or disposal releases no events and starts no work.
- Root change-sequence ownership, DTO/projector shapes, prompts, collaboration tools, task policy, persistence, and lifecycle semantics remain unchanged.
- Existing frontend exact projection hydration/focus protections remain: first inspection is guarded and atomic, later root-stream events advance the selected exact context, settlement fallback reconciliation is explicit, and configured/task/task identities at one address remain isolated.

## Review And API/E2E Authority

- Solution/design: `SR-006` and `ARCH-REV-006 Pass` supersede the rejected frontend-only causal premise.
- Implementation: `IR-003` at commit `fe9f1a286b37ce53d33999b1155bd189822a0a24`.
- Source review: `CRR-005 Pass`, 9.42/10, no open source finding.
- API/E2E: `API-REV-003 Pass`, 97.9% final confidence; broader validation was required and completed.
- Proportional durable test-code review: `CRR-006 Not Applicable`; API-REV-003 added, updated, and removed no repository-resident durable test/fixture code.
- Mandatory AC-017 proof passed for two distinct same-address task runs against a current isolated server, actual root Team WebSocket, authenticated Codex/Luna executions, current Nuxt, and actual Chrome.
- `TASK_AGENT_ACTIVATED` preceded all 82 and 78 exact task frames. Representative status, turn, content, and tool frames were present; 164 and 307 root sequences were monotonic and unique.
- Each already-open early-selected task advanced from 1 conversation / 1 Activity / Running to 2 grouped messages / 4 Activity / Idle without reload or refocus and agreed with its exact backend projection/root snapshot.
- Task one, configured `/student_two`, and task two passed exact identity isolation. Owned processes, ports, database, workspace, and browser contexts were cleaned.

## API/E2E Disclosures

- The existing mixed-task-delegation live Vitest emitted exact task frames but failed its unchanged stochastic worker-notification expectation, then cleanup hooks timed out. Its temporary edit was reverted. This is nonblocking coverage debt and was not used as Pass evidence.
- A ticket-scoped probe initially compared DOM kind `task` instead of the actual `task_agent`. The original summary remains inspectable; the ticket probe was corrected, and an independent real DOM/projection isolation rerun passed 8/8.
- API-REV-003 left no durable repository test diff; CRR-006 therefore correctly records `Not Applicable`, not Pass.

## Corrected Electron Package

The rejected DR-002 application is still running from its original path and owns port `29695`. Delivery did not stop or overwrite it. The corrected build was isolated under a new output directory.

- App: `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/task-agent-monitor-visibility/autobyteus-web/electron-dist/dr004-fe9f1a/mac-arm64/AutoByteus.app`
- DMG: `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/task-agent-monitor-visibility/autobyteus-web/electron-dist/dr004-fe9f1a/AutoByteus_personal_macos-arm64-1.4.63.dmg`
- ZIP: `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/task-agent-monitor-visibility/autobyteus-web/electron-dist/dr004-fe9f1a/AutoByteus_personal_macos-arm64-1.4.63.zip`
- Bundle identity: `com.autobyteus.app`; version `1.4.63`; Mach-O ARM64.
- DMG SHA-256: `9472ac1aacb51b368f6174afd37a83a1a8ce1c9a68445fc9ecb1c5b33575dfc3`
- ZIP SHA-256: `7bccf9724a1f420c2c9b4651ddd04cbbb47ff075f503aeabf2bf0db82fb54b2d`
- Embedded corrected gate SHA-256: `64b45025e87b61f05171ae6652ae851c6224ac655f4e196411421c8150080391`, identical to current built server output.
- Package validation: DMG and ZIP integrity, ARM64 Prisma assets, staged/final terminal-runtime checks, Electron-Node `node-pty` spawn, and isolated bundled-server migrations/health/shutdown all passed.
- Signing: local verification build only. Developer ID signing, timestamping, notarization, publication, and deployment were not performed; the executable carries only an ad-hoc/linker signature.
- Build log: `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/task-agent-monitor-visibility/tickets/done/task-agent-monitor-visibility/delivery-electron-build-dr004.log`
- Verification log: `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/task-agent-monitor-visibility/tickets/done/task-agent-monitor-visibility/delivery-electron-build-verification-dr004.log`

### Tester Safety

Before starting DR-004, fully quit the currently running rejected AutoByteus app. Otherwise macOS/Electron single-instance behavior or port `29695` ownership can return focus to the old process or prevent the corrected embedded backend from starting. Then launch only the DR-004 app/DMG above.

## Persisted Data / Compatibility / Deployment

- Persisted-data decision: `Directly Usable — No Migration`.
- Public API/DTO/schema changes: None.
- Compatibility path: None.
- Task record, prompt/tool, persistence, and lifecycle behavior: Unchanged.
- Version bump, tag, publication, deployment: Not performed or authorized.
- Rollback boundary: revert the three ticket commits if exact first inspection, activation-before-frame egress, no-reload selected-task convergence, focus/status coherence, or exact-run isolation regresses. No data rollback is required.

## Residual Nonblocking Baselines

- The historical Nuxt `vue-tsc`/TypeScript export mismatch and unrelated 14-item fixed-pixel typography audit remain nonblocking as previously recorded; current production/package builds pass.
- Electron build preparation repeats optional development-kit bin-link, dependency, and chunk-size warnings. Required guards, builds, native checks, and packaged server health pass.
- `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/task-agent-monitor-visibility/autobyteus-application-sdk-contracts/dist/` remains pre-existing, untracked, non-owned generated output excluded from the candidate.
- Build-owned `autobyteus-application-backend-sdk/dist/` was removed after packaging; ignored `electron-dist/dr004-fe9f1a/` is retained for user testing.

## DR-005 Repository Finalization And Release

- User acceptance: Received on 2026-09-01 with explicit finalization and new-release authorization.
- Archived ticket: `tickets/done/task-agent-monitor-visibility/` in ticket commit `973349c7db73489d1d99088b689067d706ce3fb0`.
- Target merge: `f87749dd4004d970d050c2ef9da7646786b8abbc` pushed to `origin/personal`.
- Release: `v1.4.64`, release commit/tag target `47b2a8629bc4e1551381711183f7104265a4a3f0`.
- Public release: `https://github.com/AutoByteus/autobyteus-workspace/releases/tag/v1.4.64`.
- Rollout: Desktop, Android APK, iOS App Store Connect, messaging gateway, and server Docker workflows all completed successfully.
- Assets: 21 published assets, including macOS, Linux, Windows, Android, messaging-gateway, and updater metadata.
- Verification: `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/task-agent-monitor-visibility/tickets/done/task-agent-monitor-visibility/delivery-release-v1.4.64-verification.json`.
- Primary `personal` worktree safety: its pre-existing non-owned dirty/behind state was left untouched; finalization used an isolated clean worktree.

## Remaining Safe Cleanup Gate

The accepted DR-004 AutoByteus application is still running from `electron-dist/dr004-fe9f1a/` inside the dedicated ticket worktree. Delivery will not delete live application resources or terminate the user-owned session. The remote ticket branch and temporary finalization worktree/branch are already removed and worktrees were pruned. The user must fully quit that AutoByteus app; delivery can then remove the remaining ticket worktree and its local branch.
