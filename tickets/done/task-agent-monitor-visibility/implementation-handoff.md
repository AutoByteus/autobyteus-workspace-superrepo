## Current Implementation Summary

The current candidate preserves the reviewed frontend exact-inspection, Activity CAS, fresh-open, focus-convergence, standalone keep-live, and dual-status implementation at `3064b084c`. `IR-003` adds the bounded `DS-009` server correction at the existing mixed task-Agent registry owner.

Each prepared task Agent now receives one stateful publisher gate. The gate buffers events in `prepared`, drains them FIFO in `releasing` (including synchronous reentrant publications), transitions to `live` only after the queue is empty, and then forwards later events directly and exactly once to the unchanged containing-Team/root publisher. Release is idempotent and completes before assignment work is queued. Abort or registry disposal closes the gate, drops retained/future events, and prevents a delayed committed release from starting work.

## Reviewed Behavior Implementation Trace

| Behavior ID | Approved Change / Preserved Outcome | Implemented Production Path / Key Files | Result / Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BEH-001–BEH-002 | Exact task selection stages and validates retained content before focus/current selection; a selected exact context subsequently advances from its live stream. | Existing frontend hydration/open owners under `autobyteus-web/services/runHydration/**`, `services/runOpen/**`, and run-history stores; new live edge from the mixed task-Agent gate into the existing root publisher. | Preserved frontend authority plus corrected live continuation. |
| BEH-003 | View-owned focus and stream effects remain authoritative across activation, reconnect, and settlement. | `teamExecutionViewState.ts`, `TeamStreamingService.ts`, and derived navigation paths at candidate `3064b084c`. | Preserved unchanged in `IR-003`. |
| BEH-004 | Task lifecycle and exact execution status remain separate and non-color-only. | Existing task presentation mapper and Team/history Vue surfaces. | Preserved; no lifecycle inference or policy change. |
| BEH-005 | Retained and subsequent exact-run conversation/Activity remain visible independently of task lifecycle or collaboration-tool choice. | Existing projection/Activity owners plus post-release task-Agent events forwarded through the root Team publisher/WebSocket. | Server event edge corrected; real-boundary convergence proof remains downstream. |
| BEH-006 | Configured and repeated same-address task runs stay isolated by exact root/address/run identity. | Existing compound frontend identity and unchanged `MixedAgentMemberHandle` execution binding/root publisher. | Preserved; no DTO/projector change. |
| BEH-007 / R-013 / DS-009 | Withhold task-Agent events before durable activation, then drain and continuously forward in one root sequence. | `autobyteus-server-ts/src/agent-team-execution/backends/mixed/members/mixed-task-agent-execution-registry.ts`. | Implemented with `prepared/releasing/live/aborted` gate; old permanent enqueue-only closure removed. |
| PB-001 | Standalone Agent `KEEP_LIVE_CONTEXT` behavior remains coherent. | Existing frontend standalone hydration/open coordinators. | Preserved unchanged. |
| PB-002 | Failed/aborted/disposed preparation emits no event and starts no work; successful activation releases once after activation publication. | Registry gate lifecycle and existing task service ordering; owner-unit coverage in `mixed-team-member-registry-task-agent-memory.test.ts`. | Implemented. Task service, persistence, and lifecycle remain unchanged. |

## Key Files Or Areas

- New live event-egress owner: `autobyteus-server-ts/src/agent-team-execution/backends/mixed/members/mixed-task-agent-execution-registry.ts`
- Owner-unit contract: `autobyteus-server-ts/tests/unit/agent-team-execution/mixed-team-member-registry-task-agent-memory.test.ts`
- Preserved frontend baseline: exact Team/run hydration/open services, `agentActivityStore.ts`, `TeamExecutionViewState`, `TeamStreamingService`, task presentation, and workspace monitor/tree surfaces at candidate `3064b084c`
- Explicitly unchanged server boundaries: `task-delegation-service.ts`, root `TeamRunEventPublisher`, Team WebSocket projectors/DTOs, Agent prompts/tools, task policy, persistence, and lifecycle transitions

## Important Assumptions

- Existing task service order remains authoritative: durable state commit, `TASK_AGENT_ACTIVATED` root publication, then `releaseWork()`.
- The injected containing-Team/root publisher remains the sole owner of root change sequences and the existing WebSocket projectors remain the sole DTO boundary.
- JavaScript synchronous execution makes the `releasing` loop a complete reentrancy boundary: publications raised by `forward(event)` append behind already queued events before `live` is entered.
- Exact projection hydration remains necessary for first inspection/recovery; the restored live edge does not replace it.

## Known Risks

- `DR-003` supersedes the historical delivery-readiness result. Existing API/E2E task-monitor coverage intercepted GraphQL/emulated Team WebSocket messages or fresh-opened retained data; it did not prove the failed real create/select-before-later-work boundary.
- API/E2E must refresh its coverage investigation and execute the real root Team socket plus real-backend early-selection browser paths required by AC-017. The implementation stage did not run or claim those checks.
- Any repository-resident durable coverage added, updated, or removed downstream must return through proportional code review before delivery.
- The full server `pnpm typecheck` command remains blocked by the repository's existing `tsconfig.json` `rootDir: src` while `tests` is included, producing TS6059 for the test tree. The production build TypeScript configuration passes with `--noEmit`.
- The SR-006 request mentioned `origin/main`, but no such ref exists in this checkout; canonical bootstrap and actual remote remain `origin/personal` at `80e2bd195`. Delivery must re-confirm the final integration target and this implementation did not alter the branch basis.

## Task Design Health Assessment Implementation Check

- Reviewed change posture: cross-boundary bug fix: bounded server event-egress correction plus preserved frontend observability safeguards.
- Reviewed root-cause classification: missing registry-owned post-durability event-sink transition; independently proven frontend first-inspection authority gap remains addressed by the existing candidate.
- Reviewed refactor decision (`Refactor Needed Now`/`No Refactor Needed`/`Deferred`): `Refactor Needed Now`, bounded to the existing registry owner.
- Implementation matched the reviewed assessment (`Yes`/`No`): `Yes`.
- If challenged, routed as `Design Impact` (`Yes`/`No`/`N/A`): `N/A`.
- Evidence / notes: the implementation replaces the permanent enqueue-only callback with one owner-local state gate and reuses the unchanged root publisher; it adds no poller, secondary transport, DTO, or Team-message inference.

## Legacy / Compatibility Removal Check

- Backward-compatibility mechanisms introduced: `None`
- Legacy old-behavior retained in scope: `No`
- Dead/obsolete code, obsolete files, unused helpers/tests/flags/adapters, and dormant replaced paths removed in scope: `Yes` — the permanent `retainedEvents.push` sink and one-shot detached drain are replaced, not wrapped.
- Shared structures remain tight (no one-for-all base or overlapping parallel shapes introduced): `Yes`
- Canonical shared design guidance was reapplied during implementation, and file-level design weaknesses were routed upstream when needed: `Yes`
- Changed source implementation files stayed within proactive size-pressure guardrails (`>500` avoided; `>220` assessed/acted on): `Yes`
- Notes: the changed registry is 225 effective non-empty lines and the implementation delta is well below the split-pressure threshold.

## Persisted Data Transition Check (When Applicable)

- Approved decision (`Not Affected`/`Directly Usable — No Migration`/`Discard or Rebuild`/`Migration Required`): `Directly Usable — No Migration`
- Design-spec decision reference: design spec Persisted Data / State Transition Decision; R-009, AC-007/AC-013/AC-015.
- Implementation follows the approved decision without an unapproved migration or version-specific runtime fallback: `Yes`
- Direct-use evidence or discard/rebuild result, when applicable: the change alters only the in-memory event callback lifecycle; stored trees, task records, projections, DTOs, and readers are unchanged.
- Migration implementation and focused checks, only when `Migration Required`: `N/A`
- Deviation from the reviewed transition decision: `None`

## Environment Or Dependency Notes

- Worktree: `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/task-agent-monitor-visibility`
- Branch/base: `codex/task-agent-monitor-visibility`, based on actual `origin/personal` at `80e2bd195c42ea3ced778dbc051d4d00edaef16f`
- Pre-rework candidate HEAD: `3064b084c74fa02f2fe06a764669a1669c58286a`
- Node/pnpm workspace dependencies were already installed.
- The standard server typecheck prehook regenerated untracked shared-package `dist/` directories. They are build output, excluded from this implementation change, and were not staged.

## Local Implementation Checks Run

- `pnpm -C autobyteus-server-ts exec vitest run tests/unit/agent-team-execution/mixed-team-member-registry-task-agent-memory.test.ts tests/unit/agent-team-execution/task-delegation-current-invariants.test.ts --no-watch` — passed, 2 files / 12 tests. Coverage includes pre-release isolation, representative handle-event FIFO/reentrant drain, live pass-through, repeated-release idempotence, abort/drop behavior, disposal before delayed release, no delayed work start, and the existing activation release invariant.
- `pnpm -C autobyteus-server-ts exec tsc -p tsconfig.build.json --noEmit` — passed for production source.
- `pnpm -C autobyteus-server-ts typecheck` — did not reach actionable diagnostics because the repository baseline includes `tests` beneath `rootDir: src`; it failed with TS6059 across the test tree. The narrower production configuration above passes.
- `git diff --check` for the changed server source/unit test — passed.
- Source-size guard — changed registry is 225 effective non-empty lines; passed.
- No API, E2E, real-backend browser, packaged Electron, or deployment execution was performed by implementation.

## Frontend Rendered-Result Check (When Applicable)

Not Applicable for `IR-003`: this round changes only the server-side event callback lifecycle and owner-unit coverage; it adds no component, style, label, layout, or frontend interaction code. The earlier frontend rendered evidence remains historical context, while actual no-reload live convergence for this server correction must be proved independently at the real GraphQL/WebSocket boundary under AC-017.

## Downstream Coverage Hints / Suggested Scenarios

- Strengthen the actual root Team-socket mixed-task scenario: require `TASK_AGENT_ACTIVATED` to have a lower root `change_sequence` than the first exact task-Agent Agent frame; require monotonic exact-ID status/turn/content/tool frames on that same socket with no duplicates.
- Exercise a failed pre-durability preparation/abort and prove no exact task-Agent Agent frame and no assignment work escapes.
- Against a real backend using Codex runtime and GPT-5.6 Luna, keep the Team already open, delegate configured `student_one` to configured `student_two`, select the exact task while only its assignment projection exists, then prove the already-selected row/header/conversation/Activity/status advance without reload or refocus.
- Compare the final selected state with the exact projection and root snapshot, and repeat the same configured address for a second task run to prove exact-run isolation.
- Treat intercepted GraphQL/WebSocket fixtures as supplementary only. If their durable repository coverage is changed, route it through proportional code re-review after execution.

## API / E2E / Executable Coverage Investigation And Execution Still Required

Yes. The historical API/E2E delivery-readiness conclusion is superseded by `DR-003`. After source review passes, `/api_e2e_engineer` must refresh the coverage investigation and independently execute the actual Team-socket and real-backend AC-017 browser paths. This handoff reports implementation-scoped source/type/unit checks only.
