# Delivery Handoff Summary — DR-010

## Current result

**Prepared — final task-branch commit/push pending.** User explicitly accepts the current package with the three known
issues and directs task-branch-only finalization. This supersedes DR009's
user-verification hold, not its historical evidence. No clean API38 Pass is
claimed. Terminal completion will be sent only after verified commit/push.

## Authority and exact package

- RER-033 / AD-REV-028 with valid AD027 / ARCH-REV-025 Pass / AAV-003 / IR-001–059 / CRR-090 source Pass (95.1/100) / API-REV-038 original Fail (85.6%) / CRR-091 user-accepted success / CRR-092 proportional test-code Pass.
- Large / High / Confirmed / Reviewed; focused Medium / High retained.
- Production source `6e2d7997444383d5585225d9febbc1ee54247714`; reviewed artifact `3155da09c33c0bb5aeea19d0b2243a8163cc9595`.
- Delivery safety checkpoint `a366f4faa1ca68bed934519c9fbb4164d672677a` includes exactly the 21 reviewed
  dirty markdown/test paths. Three durable tests retain CRR092 hashes unchanged.
- ARCH025 is the current review authority despite the older pending label in
  Architecture's design document. CRR091 acceptance supersedes API38's unwaived
  disposition; it does not rewrite API38's original execution result. CRR092 is
  Pass, not N/A; historical CRR059/067/IR041 scope remains separate.

## User verification and finalization scope

Verbatim acceptance: `code-review-evidence/CRR-091/user-acceptance.json`.
Direct finalization/target override:
`delivery-evidence/dr-010/user-finalization-authority.json`.
User says to finalize and push the current task branch for future fixes, **not
origin/personal**. This is explicit package acceptance and branch-finalization
authority, not authorization for a rollout or new native test cycle.

- Target: `origin/requirements/flat-agent-organization-model`.
- Latest original base `5645b49d6f51faa60bd3545bc8e3f0e7e3f96793` refreshed and already integrated; no base-only
  commits, no new behavior, no merge-triggered executable rerun required.
- Remote task branch initially absent. No personal checkout, target merge or
  personal push is planned/performed.
- Archived ticket: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/.codex/worktrees/flat-agent-organization-model/tickets/done/flat-agent-organization-model`.
- Current docs sync: Pass — Updated, seven cumulative durable documents.
- Commit/push: pending, with exact results to be recorded after tool confirmation.
- Release/tag/deployment/rollout/new native build: Not required for this explicitly
  source-branch-only delivery and not performed. IR049 before-cutover gate remains.
- Branch/worktree deletion and pruning: Not required — intentionally retained
  as the user's next-ticket base. Existing app/data sessions are not shut down.

## Executable evidence and accepted issues

API38: 34 main commands / 436 disjoint files / 2,708 tests; all planned journeys
and cleanup complete, no remaining planned journey. Original Fail85.6 and the
38 Pass / 3 observed Fail / 1 N/A group ledger remain. CRR092 proportionately
reviews the three carried tests; no new API execution. `known-issues.md` and
CRR091 `deferred-issues.md` go to Requirements for separate follow-up tickets.

- API38 original Fail85.6, 38 Pass / 3 observed Fail / 1 N/A groups, 320 receipts / 37 original nonzero outcomes remain unchanged. The three failures are accepted for package disposition, not converted into passing observations. No API39 or new clean API-owned Pass.
- Three accepted issues are not fixed; no introduced/preexisting attribution or completed origin investigation. Separate-link opening is accepted existing behavior. See `known-issues.md` and verbatim CRR091 acceptance.
- Native worker tests are not Electron-shell tests. Further native images were user-excluded; positive unknown-file ingestion remains untested. DR009 AppImage is historical RER032 evidence, not a current IR059 package or new user-shell acceptance.
- API35's missing Restore body and API33's missing associations are not reconstructed. AAV002 covers complete supported packages only; Org-only remains unadjudicated. AAV003 label semantics remain.
- API36/37/38 PAX preservation and 120/78/295 mtime-quantization disclosures remain scoped. Prior failed observations and corrected harness/nonzero receipts stay in their original artifacts.
- Preserve CRR059/067/IR041/API27/29, DR007/009, API20 first-guard/delay and native outer-envelope/unknown-stall limits. Historical evidence is not substituted for current API38 execution.
- IR049 actual-installation inventory decision is Architecture-owned BEFORE CUTOVER, not a coding/task-branch hold. No reset, replay, new migration, backfill, live-data repair or rollout authorized here. Other-owner data/auth/browser/provider/app sessions are untouched.

## Cumulative package and preservation

The complete incoming 6,504-reference package is retained through
`delivery-evidence/dr-010/cumulative-reference-files.txt` and its explicit
`reference-resolution.json` old-ticket-to-archive prefix map. Original upstream
reports, raw failures and compact index bytes remain unchanged; historical paths
are not globally rewritten. External Product/other-ticket references stay exact.
Raw execution data stays local and in restricted backup `/home/autobyteus/workspace/.codex/delivery-archives/AORG-FLAT-TEAM-001-DR010-20260913T033904Z`; only an
explicit audited evidence subset is added to Git. Already tracked historical
material remains in history. No live installation data is scanned or mutated.

Canonical final package: requirements/investigation/revisions/contract; complete
Architecture design/self-validation/review/revisions and applicable Product/AAV
supplements; implementation handoff/revisions; source-review/revisions;
API coverage investigation/execution/ledger/revisions; separate test-review;
`known-issues.md`; docs sync/release notes/Delivery revision and deployment report.
Use the single resolved index rather than thousands of message attachments.

## Terminal route

After verified task-branch finalization, obtain current rules and return the
complete accepted-with-exceptions package to the exact selected Requirements
recipient. No return to API/E2E, new source assignment or new follow-up ticket is
created here. Requirements may return the department result after checking the
terminal package; installation/release remains a separately authorized decision.
