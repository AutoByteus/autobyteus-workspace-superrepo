## Revision Entries

### ARCH-REV-001 — Initial clean-cut capability-discovery design pass

- Canonical design review report: `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/codex-fast-mode-investigation/tickets/done/codex-fast-mode-investigation/design-review-report.md`
- Review round and trigger: Round 1; initial architecture-review handoff after `SR-002` recorded the user's 2026-09-01 approval of the deprecated capability-discovery cleanup and rejection of effective-tier UI/runtime changes.
- Triggering role, report path, and finding IDs: `/solution_designer`; `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/codex-fast-mode-investigation/tickets/done/codex-fast-mode-investigation/solution-revision-record.md`; no architecture finding ID.
- Relevant solution revision IDs: `SR-001`, `SR-002`
- Prior authoritative decision: `N/A`
- Current authoritative decision: `Pass`
- What changed in the review result or what baseline was established: Established the initial architecture-review baseline. Confirmed the approved behavior and production path; the existing Codex row normalizer is the correct owner; canonical `serviceTiers[].id === "priority"` is the sole target capability authority; deprecated camel/snake reads and coverage are removed without fallback; stored/submitted `fast`, generic form behavior, runtime/shared-process behavior, and persistence remain unchanged. Confirmed the live catalog parity test is a downstream API/E2E coverage-investigation candidate.

#### Prior Finding Resolution

None.

- New or remaining finding IDs: None.
- Material classification changes: None; initial result is `Pass` with no unsupported material premise.
- Recommended recipient: `/implementation_engineer`
- Remaining risks or uncertainty: Future upstream provider-ID change intentionally fails closed under the approved contract; the existing live parity test must be investigated and updated if retained during downstream API/E2E coverage work; no frontend/runtime/transport/migration expansion is authorized.
