# API/E2E Test Review Report

## Review Meta

- Review Round: `3`
- Trigger: API/E2E Round 3 (`API-REV-003`, `Pass / 98.7%`) completed the user's explicitly requested real-browser full-stack validation and reported no added, updated, or removed repository-resident durable test.

- Delivery Revision Record Reviewed As Context (delivery re-entry only): `N/A`
- API/E2E Result: `Pass`

- Prior unresolved test-review findings rechecked: none. `TEST-001` was resolved and the Round 2 durable test passed proportional re-review at `CRR-003`; Round 3 did not modify it.

## Changed Durable Test Scope

Temporary browser actions, screenshots, runtime traces, logs, and isolated development state are execution evidence, not durable test code.

| Durable Test Path | Change (`Added`/`Updated`/`Removed`) | Related Scenario / Requirement | Coherent Test Responsibility | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `N/A` | `N/A` | `API-BROWSER-001`; user-requested realistic-system validation | `N/A` | Round 3 added only temporary executable/browser evidence. Repository HEAD remains `06bcb57cf365ebc6ba12aef4ba4472e091fcd066`; historical durable coverage at that commit was already reviewed and passed under `CRR-003`. |

- No durable test file changed: `Yes`
- Review result when no durable test file changed: `Not Applicable`

## Proportional Test-Code Checks

| Check | Result (`Pass`/`Fail`/`N/A`) | Evidence / Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scenario grouping and names make intent clear | `N/A` | No durable scenario changed in Round 3. The historical `API-CAT-001` name correction remains resolved under `CRR-003`. |
| Assertions prove approved requirements instead of incidental implementation details | `N/A` | No durable assertion changed. Round 3's browser prompt, rendered response, persisted runtime configuration, trace, and lifecycle logs are execution evidence only. |
| Fixtures, setup, helpers, and data builders reuse meaningful repetition | `N/A` | No fixture, helper, or durable setup code changed. |
| Test isolation and determinism are appropriate for the exercised boundary | `N/A` | No durable test code changed. The API/E2E execution report separately records isolated state and successful cleanup. |
| Large files remain coherent and navigable rather than mixing unrelated scenarios | `N/A` | No durable test file changed. |
| No stale, duplicated, disabled-without-reason, or compatibility-only tests remain | `N/A` | No durable test lifecycle action occurred in Round 3. |
| Added, updated, and removed coverage agrees with the coverage investigation and execution evidence | `N/A` | `API-REV-003` and the execution report explicitly record no repository-resident durable coverage change; `git` HEAD is unchanged from the already reviewed Round 2 commit. |

## Prior Finding Resolution

| Finding ID | Prior Status | Current Status | Related Revision / Commit | Verification Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `TEST-001` | Resolved at `CRR-003` | Remains `Resolved` | `API-REV-002`; `06bcb57cf365ebc6ba12aef4ba4472e091fcd066` | Round 3 changed no durable test. The focused Round 2 `1/1` live pass and corrected name evidence remain authoritative. |

## Findings

None.

No command was rerun during this review because Round 3 changed no durable test code. The real-browser execution itself remains owned and evidenced by `/api_e2e_engineer`.

## Latest Authoritative Result

- Result: `Not Applicable`
- Changed durable test paths reviewed: none in API/E2E Round 3
- Unresolved finding IDs: none
- Recommended Recipient: `/delivery_engineer`
- Notes: Round 3 requires no proportional test-code review beyond this `Not Applicable` record. `CRR-003` remains the passed review of the historical durable integration-test changes, `TEST-001` remains resolved, implementation source review remains `Pass`, and `API-REV-003` raises final validation confidence to `98.7%` with successful requested real-browser evidence.
