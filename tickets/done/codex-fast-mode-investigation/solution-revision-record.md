# Solution Revision Record

## Revision Index

| Revision ID | Trigger | Finding IDs | Classification | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `SR-001` | Initial user investigation request | N/A | Initial Baseline | Fast execution verified correct; no process-sharing defect |
| `SR-002` | User follow-up scope decision | `BEH-004`, `BEH-005`; `REQ-005`–`REQ-007` | Requirement refinement / design round | Approve deprecated capability cleanup only; reject effective-tier UI |

## Revision Entries

### `SR-001` — Initial Investigation-Only Baseline

- Triggering role/report/round: User request and initial direct probe round.
- Triggering finding IDs: `N/A`.
- Prior authoritative result: `N/A`.
- Current authoritative result: Backend Fast execution verified correct for installed Codex 0.151/0.152; shared-process reuse does not pin tier.
- Why recorded: Establish the evidence-backed baseline before proposing a change.
- Resolution: Preserve existing runtime execution and process ownership.
- Approved behavior/requirement IDs affected: `BEH-001`–`BEH-003`; `REQ-001`–`REQ-004`; `AC-001`–`AC-005`.
- Canonical artifacts established: requirements, investigation notes, no-change baseline design, and probe report.
- Downstream impact: No implementation route at that time.
- Remaining risk: deprecated capability metadata dependency and absent effective-tier visibility were noted as optional follow-ups.

### `SR-002` — Capability Cleanup Approved; Effective-Tier UI Rejected

- Triggering role/report/round: User follow-up decision on 2026-09-01.
- Triggering finding IDs: `BEH-004`, `BEH-005`; `REQ-005`–`REQ-007`; `AC-006`–`AC-011`.
- Prior authoritative result: `SR-001` no-change investigation-only conclusion with two optional follow-ups.
- Current authoritative result: Replace deprecated `additionalSpeedTiers` discovery with canonical structured `serviceTiers[].id === "priority"`; keep the existing configuration form and make no effective-tier runtime/UI change.
- Why recorded: The user approved one optional maintenance item and explicitly rejected model/runtime-specific state in the global run header.
- Resolution:
  - requirements narrowed to a small clean-cut model-adapter cleanup;
  - both Codex 0.151/0.152 verified to expose structured metadata;
  - full technical design completed;
  - effective-tier UI/transport/response parsing placed out of scope.
- Approved behavior/requirement IDs affected: preserve `BEH-001`; change `BEH-004`; preserve `BEH-005`; implement `REQ-005`, `REQ-006`; enforce no-change `REQ-007`.
- Canonical artifacts/sections updated:
  - `requirements.md`: approved scope, behavior map, requirements, acceptance criteria;
  - `investigation-notes.md`: 0.151 recheck, source/test ownership, user UI decision;
  - `design-spec.md`: clean-cut adapter design and removal plan;
  - `fast-mode-probe-report.md`: 0.151 evidence and final scope decision.
- Supplemental artifacts removed: rejected draft `effective-tier-ui-ux-spec.md`; it is not authoritative or part of the handoff.
- Downstream/architecture-review impact: package is now ready for initial architecture review; reviewers must not add effective-tier UI or deprecated fallbacks.
- Next recipient: `/architecture_reviewer`.
- Remaining gaps/risks: live catalog parity coverage independently reads deprecated metadata and must be classified during API/E2E coverage investigation; no product decision remains.
