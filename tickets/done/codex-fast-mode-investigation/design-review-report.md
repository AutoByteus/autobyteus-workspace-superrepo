- Current-State Evidence Basis: Source and tests at refreshed `origin/personal` commit `773bce779f195c22194c6bed1b242be6e222d06e`; direct review of the Codex model catalog, row normalizer, generic GraphQL/store/form path, runtime tier resolver/start/resume/turn path, normalizer unit coverage, live catalog integration coverage, and the supplied Codex 0.151.0/0.152.0 probe evidence.

## Upstream Behavior And Production-Path Basis Confirmation

- Overall Basis Status (`Confirmed`/`Contradicted`/`Blocked`): `Confirmed`
- Approved requirements / intended behavior understood: Replace deprecated capability discovery only. Canonical `serviceTiers[].id`, normalized to `priority`, controls whether the existing product-facing `fast` choice appears.
- Relevant existing behavior and evidence confirmed: The current catalog delegates raw rows to the Codex row normalizer; the normalizer alone reads deprecated speed-tier metadata. The resulting `ModelInfo.config_schema` is published generically. Stored `fast` is independently resolved and propagated through thread start/resume and every turn. The probe report independently verifies structured `priority` metadata and mixed-tier behavior on Codex 0.151.0 and 0.152.0.
- Scope guardrail confirmed (`In-Scope Use Cases` / `Out of Scope` / `Preserved Behavior Boundary` / `Review Authority`): `Confirmed` for `UC-001`–`UC-003`; no effective-tier UI/transport, acknowledgement parsing, runtime/process change, arbitrary tier expansion, legacy fallback, or migration is authorized. `BEH-001` and `BEH-005`, stored `fast`, Default-as-omitted, reasoning-effort behavior, and non-Codex behavior remain preserved.
- Approved change, preserved behavior, and outside scope understood: `BEH-004` changes only at the provider-row translation boundary; `BEH-001` and `BEH-005` remain unchanged.
- Every prospective blocking `Design Impact` finding is traceable to an approved requirement, acceptance criterion, or preserved-behavior ID (`Yes`/`No`): `Yes`; no blocking finding resulted.
- Remaining material ambiguity, if any: `None`.

| Behavior ID | Kind | Design Alignment With Approved Intent (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Approved Trigger / Contract And Current-State Evidence (`Pass`/`Fail`/`Unclear`) | Target Outcome / Path / Spine Coherence (`Pass`/`Fail`/`Unclear`) | Status (`Confirmed`/`Needs Correction`/`Unclear`) | Required Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `BEH-001` | User/System; preserved runtime behavior | Pass | Pass — existing form/config, bootstrap, thread start/resume, and turn paths plus live historical/probe evidence | Pass — explicitly unchanged and outside the production edit inventory | Confirmed | Preserve and verify no runtime-path edit. |
| `BEH-004` | Contract/User; capability discovery | Pass | Pass — supported user action is opening the existing configuration surface; current Codex `model/list` contract and 0.151/0.152 probes supply structured `serviceTiers`; current catalog/normalizer/form source establishes the forward path | Pass — `DS-001` and `DS-002` cover acquisition, translation, publication, and generic rendering while preserving the schema vocabulary | Confirmed | Implement the local clean-cut adapter replacement and unit coverage. |
| `BEH-005` | User; preserved presentation behavior | Pass | Pass — active-run viewing is an existing surface and the current source has no effective-tier presentation | Pass — no new path, state, or interface is introduced | Confirmed | Preserve by making no runtime-status or frontend edit. |

## Supplemental Artifact Coherence Verdict

| Artifact | Purpose And Scope Are Clear? (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Linked To Relevant Core Artifacts? (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Internally Complete? (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Consistent With Related Core Artifacts? (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Status And Approval Applicability Are Clear? (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Required Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `fast-mode-probe-report.md` | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass — complete investigative evidence, approval applicability `N/A` | None. Preserve as evidence context. |

The investigation notes contain the canonical one-item supplement inventory. The supplement is linked from both requirements and design and is consistently described as evidence rather than intended-behavior authority. The rejected UI draft is consistently excluded from the authoritative package.

## Task Design Health Assessment Verdict

| Assessment Area | Result (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Evidence | Required Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Assessment is present for the current task posture | Pass | Requirements, investigation notes, and design all classify the work as a small cleanup. | None. |
| Root-cause classification is explicit and evidence-backed | Pass | `Local Implementation Defect`: direct source review confirms deprecated field selection is confined to the existing Codex row normalizer. | None. |
| Refactor needed now / no refactor needed / deferred decision is explicit | Pass | `No refactor needed now` is explicit. | None. |
| Refactor decision is supported by the concrete design sections or residual-risk rationale | Pass | The existing catalog/normalizer boundary already owns acquisition versus provider-row translation; there is no caller duplication, bypass, mixed identity, new shared structure, or file-placement drift. | None. |

## Spine Inventory Verdict

| Spine ID | Scope | Spine Is Readable? (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Narrative Is Clear? (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Facade Vs Governing Owner Is Clear? (`Pass`/`Fail`/`N/A`) | Main Domain Subject Naming Is Clear? (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Ownership Is Clear? (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Off-Spine Concerns Stay Off Main Line? (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Verdict (`Pass`/`Fail`) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `DS-001` | Primary end-to-end capability-discovery path | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass |
| `DS-002` | Return/publication path from normalized schema to generic form | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass |

The primary spine is sufficiently stretched from the supported configuration surface through GraphQL/catalog acquisition, the external `model/list` contract, authoritative translation, schema publication, and generic rendering. No bounded loop/state-machine spine is relevant to the synchronous mapper change.

## Boundary Encapsulation Verdict

| Boundary / Owner | Authoritative Public Entry Point Is Clear? (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Internal Owned Mechanisms Stay Internal? (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Caller Bypass Risk Is Controlled? (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Verdict (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `CodexModelCatalog.listModels()` | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Client acquisition and pagination stay in the catalog; callers consume mapped models. |
| `mapCodexModelListRowToModelInfo()` / Codex row normalizer | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Provider-field interpretation and the new private predicate stay inside the existing translator. |
| Generic catalog publication/form boundary | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Consumers continue to receive only the stable generic config schema; no provider metadata leaks into UI or runtime thread code. |

## Dependency Direction / Forbidden Shortcut Verdict

| Owner / Boundary | Allowed Dependencies Are Clear? (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Forbidden Shortcuts Are Explicit? (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Direction Is Coherent With Ownership? (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Verdict (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Codex catalog and model normalizer | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Catalog may use client and mapper; mapper may use JSON helpers and product-neutral model types. |
| Generic GraphQL/store/form publication path | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | It depends on the mapped config schema and must not parse `serviceTiers`. |
| Runtime service-tier path | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | It remains separate; storing `priority`, parsing acknowledgements, or changing thread/runtime interfaces is forbidden. |

## Interface Boundary Verdict

| Interface / API / Query / Command / Method | Subject Is Clear? (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Responsibility Is Singular? (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Identity Shape Is Explicit? (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Generic Boundary Risk (`Low`/`Medium`/`High`) | Verdict (`Pass`/`Fail`) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `CodexModelCatalog.listModels(cwd?)` | Pass | Pass | Pass | Low | Pass |
| `mapCodexModelListRowToModelInfo(row)` | Pass | Pass | Pass — one raw current-contract row | Low | Pass |
| Private `supportsCodexFastServiceTier(row)` predicate | Pass | Pass | Pass — one row, canonical `serviceTiers` only | Low | Pass |
| `resolveCodexSessionServiceTier(llmConfig)` | Pass | Pass | Pass — stored product config record | Low | Pass |

All public signatures remain unchanged; provider capability ID `priority` and product configuration value `fast` remain explicitly distinct.

## Existing Capability / Subsystem Reuse Verdict

| Need / Concern | Existing Capability Area Was Checked? (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Reuse / Extension Decision Is Sound? (`Pass`/`Fail`) | New Support Piece Is Justified? (`Pass`/`Fail`/`N/A`) | Verdict (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Provider capability translation | Pass | Pass | N/A | Pass | Extend the existing Codex model normalizer. |
| Catalog acquisition/publication | Pass | Pass | N/A | Pass | Reuse without interface change. |
| Configuration rendering | Pass | Pass | N/A | Pass | Reuse the existing schema-driven form unchanged. |
| Service-tier abstraction | Pass | Pass | N/A | Pass | Correctly rejected as empty indirection for one local predicate. |

## Subsystem / Capability-Area Allocation Verdict

| Subsystem / Capability Area | Ownership Allocation Is Clear? (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Reuse / Extend / Create-New Decision Is Sound? (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Supports The Right Spine Owners? (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Verdict (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Codex model adapter | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Sole production source edit; owns provider-to-product translation. |
| Model catalog acquisition/publication | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Reused unchanged across both spines. |
| Generic web configuration | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Reused unchanged on the return path. |
| Live catalog parity coverage | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Correctly identified for downstream API/E2E coverage investigation rather than implementation-stage ownership. |

## Reusable Owned Structures Verdict

| Repeated Structure / Logic | Extraction Need Was Evaluated? (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Shared File Choice Is Sound? (`Pass`/`Fail`/`N/A`) | Ownership Of Shared Structure Is Clear? (`Pass`/`Fail`/`N/A`) | Verdict (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Structured Fast-capability predicate | Pass | N/A | N/A | Pass | One private predicate in the existing mapper is proportionate; no repetition warrants a shared file. |

## Shared Structure / Data Model Tightness Verdict

| Shared Structure / Type / Schema | One Clear Meaning Per Field? (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Redundant Attributes Removed? (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Overlapping Representation Risk Is Controlled? (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Shared Core Vs Specialized Variant / Composition Decision Is Sound? (`Pass`/`Fail`/`N/A`) | Verdict (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Existing generic service-tier config parameter | Pass | Pass | Pass | N/A | Pass | Its stored/submitted `fast` meaning stays singular; provider metadata `priority` is not added as a second product representation. |
| New shared DTO/type/schema | Pass | Pass | Pass | N/A | Pass | None is introduced; raw external JSON is locally and defensively interpreted. |

## File Responsibility Mapping Verdict

| File | Responsibility Is Singular And Clear? (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Responsibility Matches The Intended Owner/Boundary? (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Responsibilities Were Re-Tightened After Shared-Structure Extraction? (`Pass`/`Fail`/`N/A`) | Verdict (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `autobyteus-server-ts/src/agent-execution/backends/codex/codex-app-server-model-normalizer.ts` | Pass | Pass | N/A | Pass | Replace the private deprecated parser with the canonical predicate; keep mapping composition cohesive. |
| `autobyteus-server-ts/tests/unit/agent-execution/backends/codex/codex-app-server-model-normalizer.test.ts` | Pass | Pass | N/A | Pass | Covers positive, normalization, malformed/missing, non-priority, deprecated-only negative, and unchanged runtime/reasoning behavior. |
| `autobyteus-server-ts/tests/integration/services/codex-model-catalog.integration.test.ts` | Pass | Pass | N/A | Pass | Existing live parity purpose remains sound; the deprecated raw projection is an explicitly assigned downstream coverage-investigation candidate. |

## Subsystem / Folder / File Placement Verdict

| Path / Item | Target Placement Is Clear? (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Folder Matches Owning Boundary? (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Mixed-Layer Or Over-Split Risk (`Low`/`Medium`/`High`) | Verdict (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `src/agent-execution/backends/codex/codex-app-server-model-normalizer.ts` | Pass | Pass | Low | Pass | Existing provider adapter folder reflects the concrete owner. |
| Mirrored normalizer unit-test path | Pass | Pass | Low | Pass | Deterministic contract coverage stays beside the owning concern. |
| `tests/integration/services/codex-model-catalog.integration.test.ts` | Pass | Pass | Low | Pass | Existing cross-service live parity placement remains appropriate. |

The compact existing layout is proportionate; no new structural depth or mixed-layer file is introduced.

## Removal / Decommission Completeness Verdict

| Item / Area | Redundant / Obsolete Piece To Remove Is Named? (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Replacement Owner / Structure Is Clear? (`Pass`/`Fail`/`N/A`) | Removal / Decommission Scope Is Explicit? (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Verdict (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `toAdditionalSpeedTiers()` | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Delete; replace with a private canonical structured-tier predicate in the same owner. |
| `additionalSpeedTiers` and `additional_speed_tiers` production reads | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Remove both with no fallback or alias. |
| Deprecated unit fixtures/assertions | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Replace with current structured cases and an explicit deprecated-only negative case. |
| Live integration test's deprecated raw-capability projection | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Downstream API/E2E coverage investigation must classify it and update it if retained before final execution; durable coverage edits return through code review under the team rule. |

## Legacy / Backward-Compatibility Verdict

| Area | Compatibility Wrapper / Dual-Path / Legacy Retention Exists? (`Yes`/`No`) | Clean-Cut Removal Is Explicit? (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Verdict (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Production capability discovery target | No | Pass | Pass | Canonical camel-case `serviceTiers` is the sole authority; deprecated camel/snake reads are deleted. |
| Product configuration/runtime value | No | Pass | Pass | Preserving `fast` is the current product/runtime contract, not legacy capability fallback. |
| Live integration coverage | No in target coverage | Pass | Pass | The currently stale test-side projection is named for downstream investigation/update rather than accepted as target legacy behavior. |

## Persisted-Data Transition Verdict (When Applicable)

| Area / Stored Subject | Approved Decision | Representative Reader / Semantic / Invariant Evidence Is Sufficient? (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Direct Use, Rebuild, Or Migration Choice Is Proportionate? (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Migration Safety Is Complete If Required? (`Pass`/`Fail`/`N/A`) | Verdict (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Agent/team/default/member `llmConfig.service_tier` JSON | `Directly Usable — No Migration` | Pass | Pass | N/A | Pass | Stored `fast` remains accepted by the unchanged reader and runtime propagation path. Provider catalog rows are ephemeral and re-derived. Rewriting values to `priority` would violate the preserved invariant. |

## Change / Refactor Safety Verdict

| Area | Sequence Is Realistic? (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Temporary Seams Are Explicit? (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Cleanup / Removal Is Explicit? (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Verdict (`Pass`/`Fail`) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Model normalizer and implementation-owned unit coverage | Pass | Pass — explicitly none allowed | Pass | Pass |
| Live catalog parity coverage lifecycle | Pass | Pass — assigned to downstream coverage investigation | Pass | Pass |
| Preserved frontend/runtime/persistence boundaries | Pass | Pass — no seam or edit authorized | Pass | Pass |

## Example Adequacy Verdict

| Topic / Area | Example Was Needed? (`Yes`/`No`) | Example Is Present And Clear? (`Pass`/`Fail`/`N/A`) | Bad / Avoided Shape Is Explained When Helpful? (`Pass`/`Fail`/`N/A`) | Verdict (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Structured capability mapping | Yes | Pass | Pass | Pass | Shows normalized `priority` producing unchanged `enum_values: ["fast"]` and rejects dual reads. |
| Deprecated-only input | Yes | Pass | Pass | Pass | Shows that it must not enable Fast. |
| Provider/UI boundary | Yes | Pass | Pass | Pass | Contrasts server-side translation with forbidden Vue parsing. |

## Material Premise Validation (Only When Needed)

None. The decision is grounded in approved supported actions/contracts, current source, and supplied direct probes. No finding or target machinery depends on a hypothetical production, failure, or lifecycle state. The possible future change of an upstream tier ID remains a non-blocking residual risk and does not authorize compatibility machinery.

## Unresolved Approved-Behavior Or Current-State Gaps

None.

## Review Decision

`Pass`. The approved behavior basis is confirmed; the design is actionable in the current codebase, uses the existing authoritative translation boundary, cleanly removes deprecated capability discovery, preserves product/runtime/persistence contracts, and assigns the existing live parity test to the correct downstream coverage-investigation owner.

## Findings

None.

## Classification

`N/A — Pass; no blocking finding.`

## Recommended Recipient

`/implementation_engineer`

## Residual Risks

- A future Codex contract could rename the structured provider ID. The approved current behavior intentionally omits Fast when canonical `priority` is absent; no speculative alias/fallback is warranted in this change.
- The live catalog integration test remains stale until the downstream API/E2E coverage investigation classifies and, if retained, updates its independent raw-capability projection. This is an assigned coverage lifecycle item, not a design blocker or implementation-engineer-owned test edit.
- Implementation must remain backend-adapter-only apart from implementation-owned unit coverage; any frontend, runtime, transport, process-ownership, acknowledgement-parsing, or persistence edit would violate the reviewed scope.

## Latest Authoritative Result

- Review Decision: `Pass`
- Material-Premise Gate (`Pass`/`Fail`/`Blocked`): `Pass`
- Notes: `ARCH-REV-001` establishes the initial pass baseline for `SR-001`/`SR-002`. Implementation may proceed with the clean-cut normalizer change and unit coverage; the live catalog parity test remains a downstream API/E2E coverage-investigation candidate.
