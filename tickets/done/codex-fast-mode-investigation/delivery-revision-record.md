## Revision Entries

### DR-001 — Integrated documentation-synchronized delivery baseline

- Date: 2026-09-01
- Delivery round and trigger: Initial Delivery round, triggered by the code reviewer's `CRR-003` handoff after original source review Pass and proportional durable test-code re-review Pass.
- Triggering upstream report, verification, or evidence: `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/codex-fast-mode-investigation/tickets/done/codex-fast-mode-investigation/code-review-revision-record.md`; `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/codex-fast-mode-investigation/tickets/done/codex-fast-mode-investigation/api-e2e-execution-coverage-report.md`; `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/codex-fast-mode-investigation/tickets/done/codex-fast-mode-investigation/api-e2e-test-review-report.md`.
- Prior authoritative result (`N/A` for `DR-001`): `N/A`
- Current authoritative result: `Pass — the latest tracked base is already contained, exact reviewed/API-E2E-tested source and durable coverage remain unchanged, canonical docs are synchronized, and the handoff is ready for explicit user verification. Repository finalization is held.`
- Docs sync report: `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/codex-fast-mode-investigation/tickets/done/codex-fast-mode-investigation/docs-sync-report.md`
- Handoff summary: `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/codex-fast-mode-investigation/tickets/done/codex-fast-mode-investigation/handoff-summary.md`
- Release/publication/deployment report: `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/codex-fast-mode-investigation/tickets/done/codex-fast-mode-investigation/release-deployment-report.md`
- Release notes: `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/codex-fast-mode-investigation/tickets/done/codex-fast-mode-investigation/release-notes.md`
- Integration and post-integration verification:
  - Bootstrap base was `origin/personal@773bce779f195c22194c6bed1b242be6e222d06e`.
  - Delivery ran fresh `git fetch origin --prune` checks before edits and before handoff readiness. The tracked base remained exactly `773bce779f195c22194c6bed1b242be6e222d06e`.
  - Reviewed/API/E2E-tested HEAD remained `06bcb57cf365ebc6ba12aef4ba4472e091fcd066`; the base is already its ancestor with divergence `3 ahead / 0 behind` and no unmerged path.
  - No checkpoint or merge was required because the reviewed source/test state was already committed and the base had not advanced.
  - No post-integration executable rerun was required because no new base code entered the validated state. API/E2E `API-REV-002` remains authoritative for the exact unchanged source/test HEAD.
  - Delivery documentation/artifact hygiene passed: `git diff --check`, durable doc assertions, deprecated production/live-projection absence, cumulative artifact presence, focused Round 2 evidence presence, and preserved residual-health statements.
  - Evidence: `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/codex-fast-mode-investigation/tickets/done/codex-fast-mode-investigation/delivery-evidence/dr-001-integration-docs-handoff.log`.
- Documentation result: Updated `autobyteus-server-ts/docs/modules/codex_integration.md` and root `README.md` to make structured `serviceTiers[].id = priority` the discovery authority, reject deprecated fallback, and preserve distinct AutoByteus product/runtime value `fast` plus Default omission. Provider-neutral web docs remain accurate without edits.
- Release/deployment result: No version, tag, release, publication, or deployment is authorized in the current scope. Ticket-local release notes were prepared before verification for possible later explicit use.
- User verification/finalization state: Explicit user verification has not been received. Ticket remains under `tickets/in-progress`; no Delivery finalization commit/push, target merge/push, archive, release, deployment, or cleanup occurred.
- Why this baseline or delivery revision was recorded: Establish the required initial authoritative Delivery result and prove that docs/handoff were prepared from the freshly checked integrated state rather than inferred from a missing prior record or stale bootstrap state.
- Approved behavior or requirement IDs affected: `BEH-001`, `BEH-004`, `BEH-005`; `REQ-001`–`REQ-007`; `AC-001`–`AC-011`.
- Next recipient/action: User verifies the integrated handoff and explicitly approves finalization or reports a concrete finding. On acceptance, Delivery refreshes `origin/personal` again, reintegrates/rechecks if needed, obtains renewed verification if material behavior changes, archives the ticket, commits/pushes the ticket branch, merges/pushes `personal`, and performs only applicable authorized release/cleanup work.
- Remaining blockers, rollback concerns, or untested scope: Policy hold for explicit user verification. The Round 1 full live-enabled server suite remains non-clean (`63` failed files / `177` failed tests) for broad unrelated/stale debt while the target catalog file passed; the generic server typecheck remains unusable because of the pre-existing `rootDir=src` plus included-tests `TS6059` mismatch. No single browser journey combines the unchanged generic Vue consumer with the live provider catalog. A future upstream tier-ID change intentionally fails closed. None of these residuals is relabeled as a change-caused failure or clean repository result.

### DR-002 — Prior handoff held for user-requested real-browser validation

- Date: 2026-09-02
- Delivery round and trigger: Delivery re-entry after the user explicitly requested a real browser test that starts the backend/frontend, imports `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-agents`, and uses Daily Assistant with Codex Fast. The code reviewer instructed Delivery to hold CRR-003 routing because `/api_e2e_engineer` opened Round 3 before service startup.
- Triggering upstream report, verification, or evidence: `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/codex-fast-mode-investigation/tickets/done/codex-fast-mode-investigation/api-e2e-coverage-investigation.md`, Current Investigation Round `3`, pre-execution temporary browser plan.
- Prior authoritative result: `DR-001 Pass — integrated/docs-synchronized handoff ready for explicit user verification; finalization held.`
- Current authoritative result: `Held — DR-001 must not be treated as final. API/E2E Round 3 has a recorded plan but no authoritative execution or cleanup result yet. API-REV-002 remains the latest completed API/E2E result.`
- Docs sync report: `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/codex-fast-mode-investigation/tickets/done/codex-fast-mode-investigation/docs-sync-report.md` — DR-001 updates remain current for the last completed implementation state; no Round 3 docs impact is inferred.
- Handoff summary: `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/codex-fast-mode-investigation/tickets/done/codex-fast-mode-investigation/handoff-summary.md` — changed from ready to held/pending Round 3.
- Release/publication/deployment report: `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/codex-fast-mode-investigation/tickets/done/codex-fast-mode-investigation/release-deployment-report.md` — all finalization and release actions remain blocked.
- Integration and execution state: No new Delivery fetch, integration, source edit, test execution, process startup, or cleanup was performed in this revision. API/E2E owns the active isolated development state. Delivery observed test-owned generated shared-package `dist` outputs and left them untouched.
- Planned browser path: isolated repository `pnpm dev`; browser Settings package import; Daily Assistant discovery; live Codex model exposing structured Fast; Fast selection; exact-response turn through frontend/backend/WebSocket/Codex; runtime/persisted audit; browser/service/test-state cleanup.
- Durable coverage posture: No repository-resident durable test edit is currently planned. If that changes, the updated package must complete proportional code review before Delivery resumes.
- User verification/finalization state: The user has not accepted DR-001; they requested additional evidence. Ticket remains in progress. No Delivery finalization commit/push, target merge/push, archive, version/tag/release/deployment, or cleanup occurred.
- Why this delivery revision was recorded: Preserve the authoritative withdrawal/hold of the earlier ready handoff and avoid inferring a successful browser result or cleanup state from a pre-execution plan.
- Next recipient/action: `/api_e2e_engineer` completes Round 3 and publishes the authoritative coverage/execution/cleanup result. Any durable test-code change returns through `/code_reviewer`; otherwise the completed cumulative package returns to Delivery for docs/handoff reassessment.
- Remaining blockers, rollback concerns, or untested scope: Round 3 browser execution and cleanup are pending. No defect is established. Existing Round 1 full-suite and generic-typecheck residuals remain unchanged and must stay truthful in the eventual handoff.

### DR-003 — Real-browser validation passed; handoff ready for explicit verification

- Date: 2026-09-02
- Delivery round and trigger: Delivery resumed after `API-REV-003` completed the user-requested real-browser full-stack journey at `98.7%` confidence and `CRR-004` recorded Round 3 durable test-code review as `Not Applicable`.
- Triggering upstream report, verification, or evidence: `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/codex-fast-mode-investigation/tickets/done/codex-fast-mode-investigation/api-e2e-execution-coverage-report.md`; `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/codex-fast-mode-investigation/tickets/done/codex-fast-mode-investigation/api-e2e-test-review-report.md`; `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/codex-fast-mode-investigation/tickets/done/codex-fast-mode-investigation/code-review-revision-record.md`.
- Prior authoritative result: `DR-002 Held — DR-001 withdrawn from final use while Round 3 was pending.`
- Current authoritative result: `Pass — API-REV-003 browser validation and cleanup passed, CRR-004 requires no additional durable test-code review, canonical docs remain accurate, and the updated handoff is ready for explicit user verification. Repository finalization remains held.`
- Integration and post-integration verification:
  - Delivery refreshed `origin/personal` again after the Round 3/code-review return. It remained `773bce779f195c22194c6bed1b242be6e222d06e`, already an ancestor of unchanged HEAD `06bcb57cf365ebc6ba12aef4ba4472e091fcd066` at `3 ahead / 0 behind`.
  - No merge, checkpoint, or post-refresh executable rerun was required because no base, source, fixture, or durable test commit entered the validated state.
  - API-REV-003 itself validates that exact HEAD through the real isolated `pnpm dev` stack and browser path; delivery documentation/handoff assertions and cleanup-evidence checks passed.
  - Evidence: `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/codex-fast-mode-investigation/tickets/done/codex-fast-mode-investigation/delivery-evidence/dr-003-round3-return-handoff.log`.
- Real-browser result: Settings re-imported `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-agents`; Daily Assistant ran with Codex App Server, GPT-5.6-Sol, and Fast; browser rendered exact `LIVE_FAST_BROWSER_OK` and Idle; the same run recorded `runtimeKind: codex_app_server`, model `gpt-5.6-sol`, and `llmConfig.service_tier: "fast"`; WebSocket/publication and raw trace matched.
- Cleanup result: Browser tab closed, launcher stopped, ports `3000`/`8000` free, and all test-owned isolated/generated paths removed. External package and production/unrelated user data were not modified.
- Documentation result: No new long-lived edit beyond DR-001 is required. The completed journey confirms the existing README and Codex integration updates.
- User verification/finalization state: Explicit acceptance has not been received. Ticket remains in progress; no Delivery finalization commit/push, target merge/push, archive, version/tag/release/deployment, or finalization cleanup occurred.
- Why this delivery revision was recorded: Lift the DR-002 hold only after authoritative browser execution, runtime correlation, cleanup, and code-review routing completed; preserve the exact evidence and user-verification boundary without treating successful agent-executed validation as user acceptance.
- Next recipient/action: User explicitly accepts the DR-003 handoff or reports a concrete finding. On acceptance, Delivery refreshes `origin/personal` again, re-integrates/rechecks if necessary, archives the ticket, commits/pushes the ticket branch, merges/pushes `personal`, and performs only applicable authorized release/cleanup work.
- Remaining blockers, rollback concerns, or untested scope: Policy hold for explicit user verification. Round 1's unrelated non-clean full-suite baseline and the pre-existing generic typecheck mismatch remain truthful residuals. Electron-specific packaging/window/IPC was not exercised because no shell boundary changed and the requested web-equivalent journey passed.

### DR-004 — User verified; latest base integrated; finalization and stable release authorized

- Date: 2026-09-02
- Delivery round and trigger: User message “finalize and release” after the completed DR-003 real-browser handoff.
- Triggering upstream report, verification, or evidence: Explicit user acceptance; `DR-003`; `API-REV-003 Pass / 98.7%`; `CRR-004 Not Applicable`.
- Prior authoritative result: `DR-003 Pass — real-browser evidence complete; handoff ready for explicit user verification; finalization held.`
- Current authoritative result: `Pass — user verification is explicit; the mandatory post-acceptance target refresh advanced by six unrelated commits; accepted delivery edits were checkpointed, the latest base was merged without conflict, focused Codex verification passed, and repository finalization plus stable v1.4.65 release are authorized and in progress.`
- Accepted-state protection: Local checkpoint `c91749e089ddd9658231eafb351918c22922e914` contains the reviewed/API/E2E package, synchronized docs, DR-001 through DR-003 records, and accepted browser handoff.
- Post-acceptance target refresh: `git fetch origin --prune --tags` advanced `origin/personal` from `773bce779f195c22194c6bed1b242be6e222d06e` to `bed4c05a1c7860c7bd392c61dd7d26c239598284` by six commits.
- Integration result: Merge `a923fdf0a75b1a865a7dac6dcc2a2408bed22ac5` completed without conflict; new base paths concern agent-team collaboration prompt selection/docs and the completed handoff-prompt ticket, with no overlap in the Codex implementation, durable test, README, or Codex integration doc paths.
- Post-integration executable check: Shared-package preparation passed; `pnpm -C autobyteus-server-ts exec vitest run tests/unit/agent-execution/backends/codex/codex-app-server-model-normalizer.test.ts --no-watch` passed `1` file / `10` tests. Generated shared-package outputs absent before the check were removed; the pre-existing `autobyteus-ts/dist` was retained.
- Renewed verification decision: `Not required`. The merged base has no ticket-path overlap or material effect on the accepted Codex catalog/UI/browser behavior, and the relevant focused check passed.
- Documentation result: DR-001 long-lived doc updates remain accurate on the integrated state; no new docs edit is required for the unrelated base commits.
- Release decision: Current workspace/gateway version and latest stable tag are `1.4.64` / `v1.4.64`; `v1.4.65` is absent locally and remotely. The authorized next stable patch is `1.4.65`, using `pnpm release 1.4.65 -- --release-notes tickets/done/codex-fast-mode-investigation/release-notes.md` after repository finalization.
- User verification/finalization state: Verification and release authorization complete. Ticket archived at `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/codex-fast-mode-investigation/tickets/done/codex-fast-mode-investigation`; archived final commit, ticket push, target merge/push, release commit/tag/push, workflow/output verification, and safe cleanup are in progress.
- Why this delivery revision was recorded: Preserve the explicit acceptance, target advancement, accepted-state protection, integration evidence, renewed-verification decision, and release version/method before irreversible repository and release operations.
- Next recipient/action: Delivery archives and final-commits/pushes the ticket branch, refreshes and merges/pushes `personal`, publishes and verifies stable `v1.4.65`, then performs only safe cleanup.
- Remaining blockers, rollback concerns, or untested scope: No technical blocker. Release success still depends on remote workflow/publishing infrastructure. Do not rewrite a published stable tag; any correction after publication requires a later patch release. Existing Round 1 full-suite and TS6059 residuals remain unchanged.

### DR-005 — Repository finalized on personal

- Date: 2026-09-02
- Delivery round and trigger: Completion of the user-authorized archived ticket commit/push and final target merge/push sequence from DR-004.
- Triggering upstream report, verification, or evidence: `DR-004`; archived ticket commit `b463101fba3b546c478086d4a19a98e761aacd8f`; target merge `e1a1422b0306bd0f0fa98cc0a0de71637d97c904`.
- Prior authoritative result: `DR-004 Pass — user verified; latest base integrated and checked; repository finalization and stable v1.4.65 release authorized.`
- Current authoritative result: `Pass — ticket branch and archived package were pushed; the ticket was merged into current personal and the target push completed. Repository finalization is complete; stable v1.4.65 release remains pending.`
- Repository finalization sequence:
  - pushed `origin/codex/codex-fast-mode-investigation` at `b463101fba3b546c478086d4a19a98e761aacd8f`;
  - refreshed `origin/personal` and confirmed it remained `bed4c05a1c7860c7bd392c61dd7d26c239598284`;
  - merged the ticket with `--no-ff` as `e1a1422b0306bd0f0fa98cc0a0de71637d97c904` in a clean isolated finalization clone because the user's primary `personal` worktree is dirty/stale and was intentionally not modified;
  - pushed `personal` and verified the remote head equals `e1a1422b0306bd0f0fa98cc0a0de71637d97c904`.
- Verification: Ticket and base commits are merge ancestors; archived artifacts and synchronized docs are present; non-raw-evidence diff hygiene passed. DR-004 focused `10/10` remains the executable authority because no source changed after it.
- Documentation result: No additional long-lived doc impact during repository finalization.
- Release state: Current version remains `1.4.64`; next stable `v1.4.65` is authorized, available, and pending the documented release helper.
- Why this delivery revision was recorded: Establish exact repository finalization and remote ancestry before version/tag/publication work.
- Next recipient/action: Delivery runs `pnpm release 1.4.65 -- --release-notes tickets/done/codex-fast-mode-investigation/release-notes.md`, verifies all tag-triggered workflows and published outputs, then performs safe cleanup.
- Remaining blockers, rollback concerns, or untested scope: No repository blocker. Release infrastructure remains to execute. Do not manually dispatch a second release for the fresh tag unless recovery is actually required.


### DR-006 — Stable v1.4.65 released, verified, and cleaned up

- Date: 2026-09-02
- Delivery round and trigger: Completion of the user-authorized stable release after DR-005 repository finalization.
- Triggering upstream report, verification, or evidence: Explicit user instruction “finalize and release”; `DR-005`; release helper output; five tag-triggered workflow results; registry/release verification.
- Prior authoritative result: `DR-005 Pass — repository finalized on personal; stable v1.4.65 release pending.`
- Current authoritative result: `Pass — stable v1.4.65 is published from the exact release commit, every tag-triggered workflow passed, outputs were independently verified, and safe ticket cleanup completed.`
- Release execution:
  - ran `pnpm release 1.4.65 -- --release-notes tickets/done/codex-fast-mode-investigation/release-notes.md` in a clean isolated checkout;
  - bumped `autobyteus-web` and `autobyteus-message-gateway` from `1.4.64` to `1.4.65`;
  - synchronized curated notes and the managed messaging manifest to `v1.4.65`;
  - created/pushed release commit `754860d8e4a9b29454728f9dab861ba805e1c3c6` and annotated tag `v1.4.65` (tag object `2ef9f30dd85f6384726b1ac4c49398d690749626`);
  - published https://github.com/AutoByteus/autobyteus-workspace/releases/tag/v1.4.65 as a stable, non-draft release with 21 assets and the curated body.
- Workflow verification: All five workflows completed successfully against exact SHA `754860d8e4a9b29454728f9dab861ba805e1c3c6`:
  - iOS App Store Connect Release `33587668322` — build/test and TestFlight upload passed; `1.4.65 (127)`; delivery UUID `13d36e7b-06f0-4f98-b56f-3a814a7a3abd`;
  - Desktop Release `33587668323` — all five desktop architecture/OS builds and GitHub publication passed;
  - Server Docker Release `33587668343` — default linux/amd64 + linux/arm64 image published;
  - Release Messaging Gateway `33587668325` — runtime archive/metadata/checksum published;
  - Android APK Release `33587668332` — APK/checksum published.
- Registry verification: `autobyteus/autobyteus-server:1.4.65` and `:latest` both resolve to multi-arch digest `sha256:b8650d626573ec1b603e22cca9e4010023c99832bea72136c58df44750a0947d`; amd64 manifest `sha256:bcf560077ccf520e3168eb96683c7bec5a526d9b0c044e2bbaaa0747283e3201`; arm64 manifest `sha256:d15902abe73b4c5edb75890fa2e24cacfa22214593fee4fc65e97a70646b0d1b`.
- Documentation result: The synchronized README and Codex integration guide remain accurate; release/publication adds no new long-lived behavior-doc impact. Ticket release records and evidence were updated.
- Cleanup result:
  - confirmed the archived ticket commit is an ancestor of remote `personal` and the stable tag/target are durable;
  - removed `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/codex-fast-mode-investigation`;
  - removed local and remote `codex/codex-fast-mode-investigation`;
  - pruned the worktree registration;
  - deliberately left the user's dirty/stale primary `personal` worktree untouched.
- Evidence: `delivery-evidence/release-v1.4.65-command.log`; `delivery-evidence/release-v1.4.65-workflow-monitor.log`; `delivery-evidence/release-v1.4.65-verification.log`; `delivery-evidence/dr-006-post-finalization-cleanup.log`.
- Why this delivery revision was recorded: Establish a terminal authoritative delivery result rather than inferring release/deployment success from the release commit or a missing record, and preserve exact publication, rollout, registry, iOS-boundary, and cleanup evidence.
- Next recipient/action: None. Normal monitoring only. A published stable tag must not be rewritten; any corrective change requires a later patch release.
- Remaining blockers, rollback concerns, or untested scope: No delivery blocker remains. The iOS workflow uploads to App Store Connect/TestFlight but does not submit for final App Store review/public release. Round 1 full live-enabled server suite remains non-clean (`63` failed files / `177` failed tests) for unrelated/stale debt, and generic server typecheck remains unusable due the pre-existing `TS6059` configuration mismatch. Neither is relabeled as clean or attributed to this change.
