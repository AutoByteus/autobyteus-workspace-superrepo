## Changed Surface And Requirement Mapping

| Surface | Classification | Requirement / AC | Planned evidence | Material risk |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Shared Team-member LLM instruction constant | Backend/domain prompt contract | `REQ-001`–`REQ-003`; `AC-001`, `AC-002`; `SCN-001` | Exact paragraph/hash and negative semantic assertions against production export | An incomplete text replacement could retain fan-out guidance. |
| AutoByteus, Codex, and Claude prompt composition | Cross-provider runtime prompt composition | `REQ-005`; `AC-004` | Existing provider-shared/native composition parity test | Provider-specific divergence or duplicate injection. |
| `get_handoff_rules` result | Preserved service/tool boundary | `REQ-002`, `REQ-004`; `AC-003` | Existing native service, native tool, MCP-envelope, ordered-list, and empty-list tests | An accidental schema or server-side matching change; no relevant production file changed. |
| Standalone Agent prompt/tool exposure | Preserved prompt/runtime boundary | `REQ-004`; `AC-001`, `AC-004` | Existing negative parity scenario | Team-only instructions or tools could leak into standalone prompts. |
| API / transport | Unchanged | `REQ-004`; `AC-003` | Source-diff boundary plus existing tool adapter execution in focused coverage | No HTTP/GraphQL/WS contract changed. |
| UI/browser/desktop shell | `N/A` | Requirements explicitly mark UI inapplicable | No browser or desktop run | No rendered user surface exists for this change. |
| Authentication/session/permissions | `N/A` | Out of scope | None | No identity or permission path changed. |
| Process/lifecycle, persistence, workers, external integrations | `N/A` | `REQ-004`; approved data decision `Not Affected` | Source boundary inspection | No relevant runtime or data path changed. |

## Project Execution Discovery

- Runtime stack: Node.js/TypeScript monorepo, pnpm workspace, Vitest 4, TypeScript 5.9.
- Required secrets, identities, fixtures, or external services: `N/A`; tests use deterministic in-process Team contexts.
- Conflicting instruction: `pnpm -C autobyteus-server-ts typecheck` is known to hit the repository-wide `TS6059` `rootDir`/`include` mismatch. It is unrelated to the changed files and is not needed to prove this string contract.

| Instruction / configuration | Authority / learned constraint |
| --- | --- |
| `/home/autobyteus/workspace/.codex/worktrees/handoff-rule-prompt-clarity/README.md` | Workspace install uses pnpm. |
| `/home/autobyteus/workspace/.codex/worktrees/handoff-rule-prompt-clarity/autobyteus-server-ts/README.md` (`Tests`) | Run focused files with `pnpm -C autobyteus-server-ts exec vitest run ... --no-watch`; deterministic E2E is separate. |
| `/home/autobyteus/workspace/.codex/worktrees/handoff-rule-prompt-clarity/autobyteus-server-ts/package.json` | `test` uses Vitest; build and typecheck are separate. |
| `/home/autobyteus/workspace/.codex/worktrees/handoff-rule-prompt-clarity/autobyteus-server-ts/vitest.config.ts` | Node environment, serialized file execution, Prisma test setup. |

## Persisted Data Transition Coverage Basis

- Approved decision: `Not Affected`.
- Implementation agreement: No migration, compatibility reader, version fallback, or persistence path changed.
- Coverage required: None beyond verifying the diff remains confined to prompt/test/documentation surfaces.

## Existing Durable Coverage Inventory

| Path / scenario | Current intent | Related requirement / AC | Validity | Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `autobyteus-server-ts/tests/unit/agent-team-execution/agent-team-collaboration-llm-contract.test.ts` | Pins the exact prompt hash; extracts and exactly compares REQ-003; rejects old fan-out phrases | `REQ-001`–`REQ-004`; `AC-001`, `AC-002`; `SCN-001` | `Still Valid` | Rerun. |
| `autobyteus-server-ts/tests/unit/agent-team-execution/member-collaboration-instruction-provider-parity.test.ts` | Exercises production renderer and shared/native composers, one-copy injection, provider parity, standalone omission, and Team tool exposure | `REQ-004`, `REQ-005`; `AC-001`, `AC-004` | `Still Valid` | Rerun. |
| `autobyteus-server-ts/tests/unit/agent-tools/team-communication/get-handoff-rules.test.ts` | Ordered `{when, recipient_address}` entries, empty list, Team-context gating, native/MCP parity | `REQ-002`, `REQ-004`; `AC-003` | `Still Valid` | Rerun. |
| Broader live-provider/browser/API suites | Real provider response behavior or unrelated transport surfaces | Approved non-goal and unchanged boundaries | `Out Of Scope` | Do not run. Prompt compliance by a probabilistic LLM is not a guaranteed acceptance criterion. |

## Coverage Change Decisions

- Stale or obsolete coverage: None.
- Durable coverage to add/update/remove in this API/E2E round: None. Implementation already supplied focused, requirement-linked coverage at the production prompt-composition and tool-adapter boundaries.
- Temporary executable probe: None; the focused durable suite directly executes the relevant exports and compositions.

## Repository Coverage Execution Plan And Results

| Order | Command | Working directory | Boundary / scenario | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `pnpm -C autobyteus-server-ts exec vitest run tests/unit/agent-team-execution/agent-team-collaboration-llm-contract.test.ts tests/unit/agent-team-execution/member-collaboration-instruction-provider-parity.test.ts tests/unit/agent-tools/team-communication/get-handoff-rules.test.ts --no-watch` | Worktree root | Exact REQ-003 contract, shared/native provider prompts, standalone exclusion, and preserved handoff result/adapter contract | `Pass` | Vitest 4.0.18: 3 files / 10 tests passed in 1.42 s; test-owned SQLite reset and migrations succeeded. |
| 2 | `git diff --check 773bce779f195c22194c6bed1b242be6e222d06e..HEAD` | Worktree root | Patch integrity | `Pass` | Exit 0 with no findings. |

## Post-Repository Confidence Scorecard

| Confidence category | Score | Evidence | Residual uncertainty / improvement path |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Requirement and acceptance-criteria proof | `100%` | Exact production paragraph equality, old-language rejection, provider parity, standalone exclusion, ordered/empty handoff results, and adapter parity directly cover `AC-001`–`AC-004`. | None material for the approved deterministic contract. |
| Changed-boundary execution directness | `100%` | Tests import and execute the production constant, renderer, prompt composers, runtime-tool exposure resolver, service, native tool, and MCP adapter rather than copies or mocks of the changed string. | None material. |
| Cross-boundary integration realism and mock gap | `95%` | Production renderer-to-composer and service-to-native/MCP adapter paths execute in the repository test runtime. | External LLM processes were not invoked; they consume the already-proven composed string and cannot strengthen byte-for-byte contract proof. |
| Environment, configuration, identity, and fixture fidelity | `95%` | Repository Vitest 4.0.18 setup ran with deterministic current Team contexts and its owned SQLite database; no secrets or external identities are involved. | No production deployment was started, which is immaterial to a pure in-process prompt constant. |
| Failure, edge-case, lifecycle, and recovery evidence | `95%` | Multiple possible rules are represented, old fan-out mandates are rejected, empty handoffs succeed, outside-Team calls reject, standalone prompts omit Team content, and delivery success still requires tool confirmation. | Probabilistic LLM interpretation cannot be exhaustively proven and is an approved non-goal. |
| User-surface, browser, and desktop-shell confidence | `N/A` | Requirements mark UI inapplicable; no browser, renderer, preload, IPC, or native shell surface changed. | N/A. |
| Durable regression coverage quality and relevance | `100%` | Three narrow durable files protect exact wording/hash, semantic negatives, provider composition, standalone behavior, service shape, empty result, and native/MCP parity. | None material. |

- Overall post-repository confidence: `98%`
- Calculation: Arithmetic mean of six applicable categories: `585 / 6 = 97.5%`, rounded to `98%`.
- Every critical acceptance criterion directly proven: `Yes`
- Any applicable category below `90%`: `No`
- Default clean-confidence target met: `Yes`
- Material residual risk: Natural-language rule specificity remains model-interpreted and probabilistic, as explicitly accepted by the approved non-goal.

## Broader Validation Decision

- Decision: `Not Required`.
- Selected mode: `None` beyond repository execution.
- Rationale: The changed production boundary is a deterministic string composed in-process. Existing durable tests import the real production constant, renderer, prompt composers, runtime-tool exposure resolver, service, native tool wrapper, and MCP adapter. No API, UI, browser, desktop-shell, persistence, process, or external-provider contract changed. A live model call would add probabilistic model behavior but would not prove the approved exact prompt contract more directly.
- Evidence proving the real boundary: Focused repository execution passed 3 files / 10 tests and directly exercised every changed or preserved material boundary listed above.

## Not Tested / Infeasible / Deferred

| Behavior / boundary | Reason | Risk / follow-up |
| --- | --- | --- |
| LLM always chooses the correct rule for every ambiguous natural-language rule set | Explicit approved non-goal; model behavior is probabilistic | Residual product limitation only; prompt contract must be direct and exact. |
| Browser, desktop shell, live provider, HTTP/GraphQL/WS | No changed or required boundary | No follow-up unless focused checks reveal unexpected coupling. |

## Ambiguities Or Reroute Triggers

None identified.
