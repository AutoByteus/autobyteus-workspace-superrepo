## Revision Entries

### API-REV-001 — Exact handoff-prompt validation baseline

- Triggering role, report path, and round: Implementation Engineer; `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/handoff-rule-prompt-clarity/implementation-handoff.md`; round 1.
- Triggering finding or scenario IDs: `SCN-001`; implementation baseline `IR-001`.
- Related revision IDs: `RER-002`, `IR-001`; architecture-design, architecture-review, code-review, and delivery revisions `N/A`.
- Why recorded: Establishes the initial independent executable validation result for direct Small/Low package `HRPC-2026-09-01`.
- Coverage decisions or durable test paths changed: No API/E2E test changes. Existing exact-contract, provider-parity, standalone-negative, and handoff-service/adapter coverage was validated as current and sufficient.
- Scenarios rechecked: `SCN-001-A` exact paragraph/no fan-out; `SCN-001-B` Team provider composition and standalone omission; `SCN-001-C` ordered/empty handoff results and native/MCP parity.
- Command/environment delta: Focused Vitest execution passed 3 files / 10 tests on Node.js 22.23.1, pnpm 10.28.2, Vitest 4.0.18, Linux aarch64; `git diff --check` passed. Broader live/browser/API execution was not required because those boundaries were unchanged.

#### Prior Failure Resolution

None.

- Canonical artifacts updated: `api-e2e-coverage-investigation.md`; `api-e2e-execution-coverage-report.md`; this revision record.
- Prior result and confidence: `N/A`
- Current result and confidence: `Pass` / `98%`
- New or remaining failure IDs: None.
- Recommended recipient: `/software_engineering_team/delivery_engineer`
- Remaining risk: Natural-language rule specificity remains probabilistic by approved non-goal; no material validation risk or blocker remains.
