## Changed Boundary And Evidence Matrix

| Scenario | Behavior / requirement / AC | Changed boundary | Execution surface | Evidence type | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `SCN-001-A` | `BEH-001`; `REQ-001`–`REQ-003`; `AC-001`, `AC-002` | Shared Team collaboration prompt | Production constant exact/hash and semantic assertions | `Durable` | `Pass` | `agent-team-collaboration-llm-contract.test.ts`: exact REQ-003 paragraph, current SHA-256, and rejection of every-matching/distinct-recipient text. |
| `SCN-001-B` | `BEH-001`; `REQ-004`, `REQ-005`; `AC-001`, `AC-004` | Shared/native provider prompt composition and standalone exclusion | Production renderer, prompt composers, and runtime tool exposure | `Durable` | `Pass` | `member-collaboration-instruction-provider-parity.test.ts`: exact block appears once in Team prompts and never in standalone prompts; three Team tools remain exposed. |
| `SCN-001-C` | `BEH-002`; `REQ-002`, `REQ-004`; `AC-003` | Handoff service/native tool/MCP adapter contract | Repository service and adapter execution with Team fixtures and test-owned SQLite | `Durable` | `Pass` | `get-handoff-rules.test.ts`: ordered entries, empty result, context gating, and native/MCP parity. |

## Repository Coverage Execution

| Order | Command | Working directory | Boundary / scenario | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `pnpm -C autobyteus-server-ts exec vitest run tests/unit/agent-team-execution/agent-team-collaboration-llm-contract.test.ts tests/unit/agent-team-execution/member-collaboration-instruction-provider-parity.test.ts tests/unit/agent-tools/team-communication/get-handoff-rules.test.ts --no-watch` | `/home/autobyteus/workspace/.codex/worktrees/handoff-rule-prompt-clarity` | `SCN-001-A`–`SCN-001-C` | `Pass` | Vitest 4.0.18: 3/3 files and 10/10 tests passed in 1.42 s; Prisma-owned test database reset/migrations succeeded. |
| 2 | `git diff --check 773bce779f195c22194c6bed1b242be6e222d06e..HEAD` | Same | Patch integrity | `Pass` | Exit 0, no findings. |

## Validation Confidence Scorecard

Broader validation did not run because repository coverage directly executes the complete changed boundary; final scores therefore equal post-repository scores.

| Confidence category | Post-repository | Final | Change | Final evidence / residual uncertainty |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Requirement and acceptance-criteria proof | `100%` | `100%` | `0` | `AC-001`–`AC-004` directly mapped and passed; no material uncertainty. |
| Changed-boundary execution directness | `100%` | `100%` | `0` | Real production constant, renderer, composers, service, tool, and adapter executed. |
| Cross-boundary integration realism and mock gap | `95%` | `95%` | `0` | Real in-process composition and adapter boundaries; no live external LLM invocation, which is not needed for exact contract proof. |
| Environment, configuration, identity, and fixture fidelity | `95%` | `95%` | `0` | Project Vitest/Prisma setup and deterministic current Team contexts; no secret or live identity applies. |
| Failure, edge-case, lifecycle, and recovery evidence | `95%` | `95%` | `0` | Multiple rules, old wording, empty list, outside-Team rejection, standalone omission, and confirmation language covered; model interpretation remains probabilistic by non-goal. |
| User-surface, browser, and desktop-shell confidence | `N/A` | `N/A` | `N/A` | No applicable user, browser, renderer, IPC, or shell boundary. |
| Durable regression coverage quality and relevance | `100%` | `100%` | `0` | Narrow exact and semantic coverage remains in the repository. |

- Overall post-repository confidence: `98%`
- Overall final confidence: `98%`
- Calculation: Six applicable-category arithmetic mean, `585 / 6 = 97.5%`, rounded to `98%`.
- Confidence change produced by broader validation: `0`; broader validation was not required.
- Every critical acceptance criterion directly proven: `Yes`
- Any final applicable category below `90%`: `No`
- Default final confidence target met: `Yes`
- Confidence-limiting residual risk: LLM interpretation of ambiguous natural-language specificity is probabilistic, as accepted in the approved non-goal.

## Broader Validation Decision And Execution

- Decision / mode: `Not Required` / `None`
- Direct evidence: The exact changed production string and every material renderer/composer/tool-adapter boundary were executed by the focused durable suite.
- Why no live API, browser, desktop, or provider run: No such boundary changed. A live model response would be less deterministic than the exact contract checks and would not prove byte equality more directly.
- Startup, readiness, data, identities, and journey table: `N/A`

## Desktop Application Validation

`N/A — no web-equivalent renderer or desktop-shell behavior changed.`

## Platform / Runtime Targets

- Platform: Linux 6.12.54, `aarch64`
- Runtime: Node.js `v22.23.1`; pnpm `10.28.2`; Vitest `4.0.18`
- Browser / device / locale / accessibility settings: `N/A`

## Lifecycle / Upgrade / Restart / Persisted-Data Checks

- Approved persisted-data decision: `Not Affected`
- Representative existing data and migration evidence: `N/A`
- Version-specific runtime branch, dual read/write, or compatibility fallback observed: `No`
- Residual persisted-data risk: None.

## Tests Implemented, Updated, Or Removed By API/E2E

- Tests implemented or updated this round: `None`
- Tests removed: `None`
- Repository-resident durable coverage changed by API/E2E: `No`
- Added/updated paths attached for proportional test review: `Not Applicable`
- Existing implementation-owned durable paths rerun:
  - `/home/autobyteus/workspace/.codex/worktrees/handoff-rule-prompt-clarity/autobyteus-server-ts/tests/unit/agent-team-execution/agent-team-collaboration-llm-contract.test.ts`
  - `/home/autobyteus/workspace/.codex/worktrees/handoff-rule-prompt-clarity/autobyteus-server-ts/tests/unit/agent-team-execution/member-collaboration-instruction-provider-parity.test.ts`
  - `/home/autobyteus/workspace/.codex/worktrees/handoff-rule-prompt-clarity/autobyteus-server-ts/tests/unit/agent-tools/team-communication/get-handoff-rules.test.ts`

## Other Execution Artifacts / Temporary Methods / Mocking

- Other retained execution artifacts: This report and the canonical coverage investigation only.
- Temporary probes or scaffolding: None.
- Mocked external dependencies: None material to the changed prompt contract. Test Team contexts are deterministic fixtures; no external provider is part of the approved boundary.

## Result Summary

| Result | Scenario IDs | Summary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Pass` | `SCN-001-A`–`SCN-001-C` | Exact single-most-specific-rule/single-recipient wording, provider composition, standalone exclusion, and preserved handoff tool contract all passed. |

## Cleanup Performed

| Resource | Ownership | Cleanup | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Vitest Prisma database under `autobyteus-server-ts/tests/.tmp/` | Test harness | Managed by project global setup; no user or development database used | `Pass`; no tracked residue. |
| Processes / browser state / external data | N/A | None created | `N/A` |
