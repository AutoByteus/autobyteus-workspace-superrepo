# Implementation Revision Record

The current code and `implementation-handoff.md` remain authoritative.

## Revision Entries

### IR-001 — Single-recipient handoff prompt baseline

- Triggering role, report path, and round: Requirements Engineer; `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/handoff-rule-prompt-clarity/requirements-doc.md`; initial implementation.
- Triggering finding IDs: `N/A`
- Classification: `Initial Baseline`
- Prior authoritative result: `N/A`
- Current authoritative result: The shared Team-member collaboration prompt contains exact REQ-003 single-recipient wording; focused prompt contract, SCN-001, provider-parity, preserved tool-contract checks, and directly affected documentation are current.
- Related architecture design revision IDs: `N/A`
- Related architecture-review revision IDs: `N/A`
- Related code-review revision IDs: `N/A`
- Related API/E2E revision IDs: `N/A`
- Related delivery revision IDs: `N/A`
- Why this baseline or implementation revision is recorded: Establishes the initial approved direct-route implementation and its validation evidence before downstream executable validation.
- Approved behavior or requirement IDs affected: `BEH-001`, `BEH-002`; `REQ-001`–`REQ-005`; `AC-001`–`AC-004`; `SCN-001`.
- Implementation delta: Replaced the every-matching/distinct-recipient paragraph with exact REQ-003 through the existing shared prompt constant; updated the pinned SHA-256 to `1c63e9fea21d2edb3a8ce46cc4843f9eecde53b97938d2f87ff1213764349976`; added focused exact/negative scenario assertions and provider parity assertions; synchronized prompt engineering and Team execution docs. No service/schema/compiler/delivery/delegation/lifecycle behavior changed.
- Changed files or areas: `agent-team-collaboration-llm-contract.ts`; two focused `agent-team-execution` unit-test files; `docs/modules/prompt_engineering.md`; `docs/modules/agent_team_execution.md`; development commit `87679f93a`.
- Local validation and result: Focused Vitest suite passed (3 files/10 tests); production TypeScript build config passed after Prisma generation; full server build/bootstrap smoke passed; diff check passed. The broader typecheck script exposed the existing `rootDir: src` plus `include: tests` TS6059 configuration mismatch.
- Next recipient or routing: `Direct API/E2E`; exact recipient is resolved from `get_handoff_rules` after artifact completion.
- Remaining limitations or risks: Independent API/E2E validation remains; model interpretation of natural-language rule specificity remains probabilistic by approved non-goal.
