## Current Implementation Summary

The shared AgentTeam collaboration prompt now contains the exact approved REQ-003 paragraph as one uninterrupted paragraph. It tells a completed or blocked Team-bound Agent to evaluate possible rules, select the single most specifically applicable rule, notify only that rule's recipient, avoid additional recipients for the same outcome, and finish normally when none applies. The exact prompt hash, focused SCN-001 assertions, provider-parity assertions, and durable prompt/team-execution documentation were updated. The handoff-rule service/schema, compilation, addressing, message delivery, delegation, lifecycle, and standalone-Agent composition were not changed.

## Routing Classification (Mandatory)

- Task size (`Small`/`Medium`/`Large`): `Small`
- Architecture risk (`Low`/`High`): `Low`
- Requirements routing assessment path: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/handoff-rule-prompt-clarity/requirements-doc.md`
- Classification confirmed or changed: `Confirmed`
- Evidence and rationale for confirmation or change: The completed delta is limited to one existing shared prompt constant, two focused unit-test files, and two directly affected durable documentation pages. It introduces no API/schema, persistence, security, concurrency, deployment, lifecycle, ownership-boundary, migration, or structural change.
- Selected route (`Direct API/E2E`/`Code Review`/`Architecture Designer`): `Direct API/E2E`
- Lightweight implementation self-review completed for the direct route: `Yes`
- New design impact or escalation trigger: `None`

## Reviewed Behavior Implementation Trace

| Behavior ID | Approved Change / Preserved Outcome | Implemented Production Path / Key Files | Result / Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BEH-001 | Replace fan-out guidance with one most-specific rule and one recipient while preserving confirmed delivery guidance and no-rule completion. | `agent-team-collaboration-llm-contract.ts` → existing `member-collaboration-instruction-renderer.ts` → shared/native provider prompt composers; contract and provider-parity tests. | Implemented. The Rule-Based Handoffs section equals the exact REQ-003 paragraph; old every-matching/distinct-recipient language is absent. |
| BEH-002 | Preserve the read-only ordered `{when, recipient_address}` possible-rule result and Agent-side evaluation boundary. | Existing `get-handoff-rules-service.ts` and tool contract remain unchanged; existing focused tool tests were rerun. | Preserved. No service, schema, compiler, resolver, or delivery file changed. |

## Key Files Or Areas

- `/home/autobyteus/workspace/.codex/worktrees/handoff-rule-prompt-clarity/autobyteus-server-ts/src/agent-collaboration/domain/agent-team-collaboration-llm-contract.ts`
- `/home/autobyteus/workspace/.codex/worktrees/handoff-rule-prompt-clarity/autobyteus-server-ts/tests/unit/agent-team-execution/agent-team-collaboration-llm-contract.test.ts`
- `/home/autobyteus/workspace/.codex/worktrees/handoff-rule-prompt-clarity/autobyteus-server-ts/tests/unit/agent-team-execution/member-collaboration-instruction-provider-parity.test.ts`
- `/home/autobyteus/workspace/.codex/worktrees/handoff-rule-prompt-clarity/autobyteus-server-ts/docs/modules/prompt_engineering.md`
- `/home/autobyteus/workspace/.codex/worktrees/handoff-rule-prompt-clarity/autobyteus-server-ts/docs/modules/agent_team_execution.md`

## Important Assumptions

- None beyond the approved requirements. Returned order remains a preserved tool-result fact, not a new selection-priority contract.

## Known Risks

- Natural-language rule interpretation remains model-driven and probabilistic, as explicitly accepted by the approved non-goals.
- The repository `pnpm -C autobyteus-server-ts typecheck` script currently fails broadly with `TS6059` because `tsconfig.json` sets `rootDir: "src"` while including `tests`. This is unrelated to the changed files; the production build compiler and focused tests pass.

## Task Design Health Assessment Implementation Check

- Reviewed change posture: Bounded clean replacement through the existing shared collaboration prompt surface.
- Reviewed root-cause classification: The authoritative fixed prompt explicitly mandated every-matching/distinct-recipient fan-out.
- Reviewed refactor decision (`Refactor Needed Now`/`No Refactor Needed`/`Deferred`): `No Refactor Needed`
- Implementation matched the reviewed assessment (`Yes`/`No`): `Yes`
- If challenged, routed as `Design Impact` (`Yes`/`No`/`N/A`): `N/A`
- Evidence / notes: The existing prompt constant and renderer supported the exact approved wording without new boundaries or control flow.

## Legacy / Compatibility Removal Check

- Backward-compatibility mechanisms introduced: `None`
- Legacy old-behavior retained in scope: `No`
- Dead/obsolete code, obsolete files, unused helpers/tests/flags/adapters, and dormant replaced paths removed in scope: `Yes` — the superseded prompt paragraph and its old hash were replaced directly.
- Shared structures remain tight (no one-for-all base or overlapping parallel shapes introduced): `Yes`
- Canonical shared design guidance was reapplied during implementation, and file-level design weaknesses were routed upstream when needed: `Yes`
- Changed source implementation files stayed within proactive size-pressure guardrails (`>500` avoided; `>220` assessed/acted on): `Yes`
- Notes: The only changed source implementation file has 124 effective non-empty lines and a 14-line edit delta.

## Persisted Data Transition Check (When Applicable)

- Approved decision (`Not Affected`/`Directly Usable — No Migration`/`Discard or Rebuild`/`Migration Required`): `Not Affected`
- Design-spec decision reference: `N/A — direct route; requirements Data Continuity And Acceptable Loss section`
- Implementation follows the approved decision without an unapproved migration or version-specific runtime fallback: `Yes`
- Direct-use evidence or discard/rebuild result, when applicable: `N/A`
- Migration implementation and focused checks, only when `Migration Required`: `N/A`
- Deviation from the reviewed transition decision: `None`

## Environment Or Dependency Notes

- Dependencies were installed from the unchanged frozen workspace lockfile with pnpm 10.28.2.
- Prisma client generation was required for the repository build/compiler check; no Prisma schema or generated artifact was committed.

## Local Implementation Checks Run

- `pnpm -C autobyteus-server-ts exec vitest run tests/unit/agent-team-execution/agent-team-collaboration-llm-contract.test.ts tests/unit/agent-team-execution/member-collaboration-instruction-provider-parity.test.ts tests/unit/agent-tools/team-communication/get-handoff-rules.test.ts --no-watch` — passed twice; final run: 3 files, 10 tests.
- `pnpm -C autobyteus-server-ts exec prisma generate --schema ./prisma/schema.prisma && pnpm -C autobyteus-server-ts exec tsc -p tsconfig.build.json --noEmit` — passed.
- `pnpm -C autobyteus-server-ts build` — passed, including shared-package builds and sanitized built-in-agent bootstrap smoke.
- `git diff --check` — passed before the development commit.
- `pnpm -C autobyteus-server-ts typecheck` — did not complete because of the repository-wide `TS6059` rootDir/include mismatch described under Known Risks; production `tsconfig.build.json` compilation passed.

## Frontend Rendered-Result Check (When Applicable)

`Not Applicable` — this change affects backend-composed model instruction text and no rendered frontend or user interaction surface.

## Downstream Coverage Hints / Suggested Scenarios

- Inspect the rendered Rule-Based Handoffs section and verify byte-for-byte equality with REQ-003.
- Render provider-shared and native Team-member prompts; verify the collaboration block appears exactly once and carries the single-recipient paragraph for AutoByteus, Codex, and Claude composition paths.
- Verify standalone-Agent prompts still omit AgentTeam addressing/collaboration content and intrinsic Team tools.
- Reconfirm `get_handoff_rules` returns ordered possible `{when, recipient_address}` entries, including `handoffs: []`, without server-side matching.
- With multiple possible rules in a prompt fixture, assert the instructions permit only the single most-specific rule's recipient and expressly prohibit additional recipients for the same outcome.

## API / E2E / Executable Coverage Investigation And Execution Still Required

Independent API/E2E investigation and validation remain required. Implementation-local checks do not constitute downstream sign-off.
