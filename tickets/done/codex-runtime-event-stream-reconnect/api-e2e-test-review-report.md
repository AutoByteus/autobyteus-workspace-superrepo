## Changed Durable Test Scope

Temporary execution logs, generated setup outputs, and the live test run are evidence only. The repository-resident durable change is one lifecycle integration rename/replacement plus one new scenario.

| Durable Test Path | Change (`Added`/`Updated`/`Removed`) | Related Scenario / Requirement | Coherent Test Responsibility | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/codex-runtime-event-stream-reconnect-release-v1.4.67/autobyteus-web/tests/integration/codex-turn-lifecycle-native-to-live-projection.integration.test.ts` | `Added` as the renamed/replacement path and expanded | `API-SC-001`, `API-SC-002`; `BEH-001`-`BEH-003`; `AC-001`-`AC-003`, `AC-005`-`AC-007` | Joins native Codex notifications through real thread/backend/AgentRun/wire/frontend owners, and for retry continuation also observes the current JSONL recorder. | Contains two related lifecycle cases: retry-diagnostic continuation/persistence and retained stale-A/active-B containment. |
| `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/codex-runtime-event-stream-reconnect-release-v1.4.67/autobyteus-web/tests/integration/codex-stale-turn-boundary-projection.integration.test.ts` | `Removed` | `API-SC-002`; `AC-005`, `AC-006` | Replaced by the broader lifecycle-oriented file above. | `durable-coverage.diff` confirms the scenario and assertions were retained rather than deleted. |

- No durable test file changed: `No`
- Review result when no durable test file changed: `N/A`

## Proportional Test-Code Checks

| Check | Result (`Pass`/`Fail`/`N/A`) | Evidence / Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scenario grouping and names make intent clear | `Pass` | The file and `describe` block now identify the shared Codex turn-lifecycle boundary. The two test names distinguish retry continuation from stale-terminal containment. |
| Assertions prove approved requirements instead of incidental implementation details | `Pass` | `API-SC-001` checks exact diagnostic scope/effect/identity at canonical and wire boundaries, continued thread/run/frontend state, absence of a diagnostic-forced reasoning end, preserved tool lifecycle, later same-turn content, final idle/completion, and current JSONL reasoning/tool/assistant facts. `API-SC-002` retains the user-visible one-response and no-stale-emission assertions. |
| Fixtures, setup, helpers, and data builders reuse meaningful repetition | `Pass` | The existing native-to-projection harness is generalized with optional `memoryDir`; shared projection construction, mapper dispatch, wait helper, and JSONL reader keep scenario bodies focused. |
| Test isolation and determinism are appropriate for the exercised boundary | `Pass` | Native notifications are deterministic and enter the real production owners. Persistence uses an OS temporary directory registered before harness creation, recorder queues are awaited, the recorder listener is detached in `finally`, and `afterEach` removes only registered directories. |
| Large files remain coherent and navigable rather than mixing unrelated scenarios | `Pass` | At 472 lines, the file is substantial but contains only two closely related end-to-end lifecycle cases using one shared harness. Test-source size thresholds do not apply, and splitting would duplicate the joined setup. |
| No stale, duplicated, disabled-without-reason, or compatibility-only tests remain | `Pass` | The old path is removed as a true rename/replacement, its stale-boundary coverage remains intact, and no skipped, alias, retry-text-classification, or legacy-shape scenario was added. |
| Added, updated, and removed coverage agrees with the coverage investigation and execution evidence | `Pass` | `durable-coverage.diff` matches the current file and removed path. `web-lifecycle-integration.log` records 2/2 passing cases, and `API-REV-001` accurately identifies the path change and added `API-SC-001` scope. |

## Findings

None.

## Latest Authoritative Result

- Result: `Pass`
- Changed durable test paths reviewed: `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/codex-runtime-event-stream-reconnect-release-v1.4.67/autobyteus-web/tests/integration/codex-turn-lifecycle-native-to-live-projection.integration.test.ts`; removed/replaced `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/codex-runtime-event-stream-reconnect-release-v1.4.67/autobyteus-web/tests/integration/codex-stale-turn-boundary-projection.integration.test.ts`
- Unresolved finding IDs: None.
- Recommended Recipient: `/delivery_engineer`
- Notes: Proportional review is limited to API/E2E-owned durable test code. The passed implementation source report and scorecard remain unchanged. The renamed integration is coherent, deterministic, requirement-linked, and consistent with the successful `API-REV-001` evidence.
