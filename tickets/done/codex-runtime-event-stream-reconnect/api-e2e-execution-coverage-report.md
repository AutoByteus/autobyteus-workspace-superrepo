## Investigation And Execution Basis

- Coverage investigation artifact: `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/codex-runtime-event-stream-reconnect-release-v1.4.67/tickets/done/codex-runtime-event-stream-reconnect/api-e2e-coverage-investigation.md`
- Investigation completed before durable coverage changes or final execution: `Yes`
- Investigation plan followed: `Yes` — exact planned repository and live lifecycle surfaces were executed. The joined integration had one assertion-order correction during authoring and one later wrong-working-directory prerequisite invocation; both were local coverage/execution corrections and the final intended command passed.
- Existing coverage decisions revised during execution, with evidence: No validity decision changed. `API-SC-001` confirmed that the stale-only file should become a broader turn-lifecycle integration while retaining `API-SC-002` unchanged.
- Reroute required before or during execution: `No`
- Notes: No production source, fixture, package manifest, lockfile, migration, or application configuration changed during API/E2E. One durable test file was renamed and expanded.

## Compatibility / Legacy Scope Check

- Reviewed requirements/design introduce, tolerate, or ambiguously describe backward compatibility in scope: `No`
- Compatibility-only or legacy-retention behavior observed in implementation: `No`
- Approved persisted-data transition followed without unnecessary migration or version-specific runtime fallback: `Yes`
- Durable coverage added or retained only for compatibility-only behavior: `No`
- If compatibility-related invalid scope was observed, reroute classification used: `N/A`
- Upstream recipient notified: `N/A`

## Changed Boundary And Evidence Matrix

| Scenario ID | Behavior / Requirement / Acceptance-Criteria IDs | Changed Boundary | Execution Surface / Mode | Evidence Type | Result | Evidence / Artifact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `API-SC-001` | Retry diagnostic preserves exact turn/correlation and admits/persists/projects later work; `BEH-001`/`BEH-002`, `REQ-001`-`REQ-003`/`REQ-006`, `AC-001`-`AC-003`/`AC-007` | Native Codex notification -> `CodexThread` -> converter -> `AgentRun` -> mapper/frontend plus JSONL recorder | Nuxt Vitest joined integration with fake native client and real production owners | `Durable` | `Pass` | `autobyteus-web/tests/integration/codex-turn-lifecycle-native-to-live-projection.integration.test.ts`; `api-e2e-evidence/web-lifecycle-integration.log` |
| `API-SC-002` | Late terminal/completion A cannot mutate or project over active B; `BEH-003`, `REQ-004`/`REQ-005`, `AC-005`/`AC-006` | Exact stale containment through frontend state | Same joined integration | `Durable` | `Pass` | Same test path/log; existing scenario retained after rename |
| `API-SC-003` | Exact retry/terminal classification, diagnostic reasoning/tool preservation, exact-turn cleanup, runtime-global and identity fallback | Thread and converter owners | Five focused server suites | `Durable` | `Pass` | `api-e2e-evidence/server-focused.log`; 5 files / 167 tests |
| `API-SC-004` | Diagnostic WebSocket remains running; retired-turn content rejected across reconnect | Canonical AgentRun -> real server WebSocket sessions | Selected server integration | `Durable` | `Pass` | `api-e2e-evidence/server-websocket-selected.log`; 2 selected tests passed |
| `API-SC-005` | Existing current JSONL shapes remain directly readable and projectable without migration | Raw trace -> historical replay/run view | Server reader unit suites | `Durable` | `Pass` | `api-e2e-evidence/server-run-view-readers.log`; 2 files / 15 tests |
| `API-SC-006` | Current installed Codex CLI/app-server completes a real turn through backend/AgentRun and current JSONL persistence | External process and runtime lifecycle | Focused env-gated live Codex memory E2E | `Live` | `Pass` | `api-e2e-evidence/live-codex-memory.log`; 1 selected test passed / 2 skipped |
| `API-SC-007` | Production source types, web production boundary, patch whitespace | Build/static boundaries | TypeScript, boundary guard, Git check | `Durable` | `Pass` | `api-e2e-evidence/static-and-boundary-checks.log` |

## Additional Repository Coverage Execution

No repository command was added after the post-repository scorecard. The subsequent command was the planned broader live lifecycle execution. A final rerun of the changed web integration passed after its test-only run/workspace labels were generalized; it is represented by the authoritative `web-lifecycle-integration.log`.

## Validation Confidence Scorecard (Mandatory)

| Confidence Category | Post-Repository Score | Final Score | Change | New / Final Supporting Evidence | Residual Uncertainty |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Requirement and acceptance-criteria proof | `96%` | `97%` | `+1` | All deterministic acceptance scenarios pass; real current Codex success/persistence complements preserved `AC-006`/`AC-007` | Exact real retry was not induced |
| Changed-boundary execution directness | `97%` | `97%` | `0` | Exact retry path executes every changed owner and ends in canonical, wire, frontend and persistence observations | Native retry event is injected at the supported handler boundary |
| Cross-boundary integration realism and mock gap | `93%` | `94%` | `+1` | Real `CodexThread`, backend, `AgentRun`, mapper, projector, recorder, server WebSocket, and separate real Codex process path all pass | Exact retry and real process evidence are compositional because provider failure timing is uncontrollable |
| Environment, configuration, identity, and fixture fidelity | `92%` | `97%` | `+5` | Node/pnpm/Codex versions match project guidance; generated prerequisites pass; real model catalog/auth/startup/idle and isolated JSONL persistence pass | No production profile or user data was used, by design |
| Failure, edge-case, lifecycle, and recovery evidence | `98%` | `98%` | `0` | Retry, matching terminal, stale error/completion/status, runtime-global, identity-missing, correlation and reconnect paths pass | Real network failure injection remains infeasible |
| User-surface, browser, and desktop-shell confidence | `95%` | `95%` | `0` | Production frontend projector visibly retains one incomplete response, diagnostic error segment, continuing tool/text, and final idle state; no UI/shell source changed | Pixel appearance was not revalidated; severe-looking card remains approved out of scope |
| Durable regression coverage quality and relevance | `98%` | `98%` | `0` | One focused joined scenario was added; existing stale scenario retained; tests have isolated state/cleanup and exact requirement-linked assertions | Proportional test-code review remains the next gate |

- Overall post-repository confidence: `95.6%`
- Overall final confidence: `96.6%`
- Calculation method: Simple average of the seven applicable categories, rounded to one decimal; no weak category is hidden.
- Confidence change produced by broader validation: `+1.0` percentage point overall; it removed the environment/current-process uncertainty and strengthened the external-runtime half without claiming a forced retry.
- Every critical acceptance criterion directly proven: `Yes`
- Any final applicable category below `90%`: `No`
- Default final confidence target of `95%` met: `Yes`
- Confidence-limiting residual risks: A live provider response-WebSocket retry was not deliberately induced; the diagnostic card appearance is unchanged; future Codex protocol drift and historical repair remain out of scope.

## Broader Validation Decision And Execution

- Decision and selected execution mode from the coverage investigation: `Required`; `Lifecycle` using a real Codex App Server process.
- Material deviation from the planned mode or rationale: None.
- Confidence gap or residual risk actually addressed: Proved that the worktree's current Codex CLI 0.152.1, model catalog, app-server startup, native stream, backend/AgentRun lifecycle, idle completion, and current JSONL writer operate together.
- If `Not Required`, direct evidence that made broader validation unnecessary: `N/A`
- If `Blocked`, exact unavailable dependency or access and attempted alternatives: `N/A`
- Startup order, commands, and readiness results: After documented shared/Prisma/Nuxt setup, ran `RUN_CODEX_E2E=1 pnpm exec vitest run tests/e2e/memory/codex-live-memory-persistence.e2e.test.ts --no-watch -t "persists raw traces without WorkingContext"` from `autobyteus-server-ts`. Model catalog and thread startup succeeded; the run reached canonical idle; 1 selected test passed in 20.334 seconds (24.64-second file duration).
- Environment choices that materially affected the run: macOS Darwin 25.5.0 ARM64; Node 22.23.1; pnpm 10.28.2; `codex-cli 0.152.1`; model `gpt-5.6-sol`; reasoning effort `low`; no tools requested; no sandbox escalation.
- Seed data, fixtures, identities, authentication, permissions, or session state: Suite-created random run/response token and temporary workspace/memory directories; existing local Codex authentication; no credential value inspected or recorded.

| Scenario / Journey Step | Expected Observable Result | Actual Observable Result | DOM / Screenshot / Log / API / Process Evidence | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Start current Codex app server and resolve a supported model | Startup gate becomes ready with current model | `gpt-5.6-sol` resolved and run published | `live-codex-memory.log` | `Pass` |
| Send one no-tool prompt through real AgentRun/Codex backend | One native turn completes and canonical status becomes idle | Selected test reached idle and completed in 20.334 seconds | Vitest lifecycle assertions and log | `Pass` |
| Persist current turn output | Current JSONL contains system, reasoning and assistant facts without legacy `WorkingContext` | Existing live-memory assertions passed; cadence output records one normalized and persisted reasoning trace with equal content length | `live-codex-memory.log` | `Pass` |
| Teardown owned process/state | Test client/thread and temporary directories are removed | Suite `afterEach` completed and test exited cleanly; no registered `codex-live-memory-*` temp directory remained | Suite result and cleanup check | `Pass` |

## Desktop Application Validation (When Applicable)

- Validation approach executed and any deviation from the investigation: Programmatic Nuxt integration plus server WebSocket integration, exactly as planned; no Electron launch.
- Browser-tested web-equivalent behavior and evidence: No browser was needed. The production `dispatchAgentStreamMessage` path was directly exercised in Nuxt Vitest and ended in the real `AgentContext` conversation/status state.
- Shell-specific or lifecycle behavior and evidence: No shell-specific behavior changed. Real Codex child-process lifecycle was exercised by `API-SC-006` outside Electron.
- Effect on any already-running desktop application: `None`
- Behavior not directly proven and confidence consequence: Pixel/DOM rendering of the unchanged diagnostic card was not tested; user-surface category remains `95%`, not `100%`.

## Platform / Runtime Targets

- Operating system / platform: macOS/Darwin 25.5.0, ARM64 (`MacBookPro` host)
- Runtime and relevant framework versions: Node.js 22.23.1; pnpm 10.28.2; server Vitest 4.0.18; web Vitest 3.2.4; Nuxt 3.21.x workspace; Codex CLI 0.152.1; Electron package 42.4.1 (not launched)
- Browser / engine and version, when applicable: `N/A`
- Device, viewport, locale, timezone, or accessibility settings, when applicable: `N/A`; timezone Europe/Berlin did not affect assertions

## Lifecycle / Upgrade / Restart / Persisted-Data Checks

- Approved persisted-data decision: `Directly Usable — No Migration`
- Representative existing data exercised: Existing current-shape raw user/assistant/reasoning/tool trace fixtures through normal reader/transformer suites; newly written same-turn reasoning/tool/assistant facts after an injected retry diagnostic; real live Codex output through current writer.
- Direct-use, discard/rebuild, or migration result and evidence: `Pass`; no schema or reader change was required. `API-SC-001`, `API-SC-005`, and `API-SC-006` prove current write/read behavior.
- Migration completion/recovery evidence, only when `Migration Required`: `N/A`
- Version-specific runtime branch, dual read/write, or compatibility fallback observed: `No`
- Residual untested persisted-data risk: Previously discarded events remain absent and are not reconstructed, exactly as approved. Transient `ERROR` events are live canonical content; the durable raw-trace writer persists the later conversation/tool facts whose loss caused the defect.

## Tests Implemented Or Updated

| Path / Scenario | Change | Requirement / Boundary | Execution Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `autobyteus-web/tests/integration/codex-turn-lifecycle-native-to-live-projection.integration.test.ts` / `API-SC-001` | `Added` within renamed file | `AC-001`-`AC-003`, `AC-007`; native through AgentRun/wire/frontend/JSONL | `Pass` | Asserts diagnostic evidence, running/incomplete state, no diagnostic-forced reasoning close, tool success, later content, final idle, and post-diagnostic durable facts |
| Same path / `API-SC-002` | `Updated` path/name only; assertions retained | `AC-005`/`AC-006`; stale A/active B containment | `Pass` | Existing scenario remains unchanged except shared generalized harness labels |

## Tests Removed As Stale Or Obsolete

| Path / Scenario | Obsolete Assertion | Upstream Evidence | Replacement Coverage Or No-Replacement Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `autobyteus-web/tests/integration/codex-stale-turn-boundary-projection.integration.test.ts` path | None | `BEH-001`/`BEH-002` require the same joined harness to protect the retry continuation path | Renamed to `codex-turn-lifecycle-native-to-live-projection.integration.test.ts`; all stale-boundary assertions retained and one retry scenario added |

## Other Execution Artifacts

| Artifact Path | Type / Purpose | Retained Or Temporary | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tickets/done/codex-runtime-event-stream-reconnect/api-e2e-evidence/setup.log` | Build/setup evidence | Retained | Includes initial setup plus one incorrect web-package `prepare:shared` attempt and the corrected server-package invocation |
| `.../api-e2e-evidence/server-focused.log` | Focused server test output | Retained | 167/167 passed |

## Temporary Execution Methods / Scaffolding

| Path / Method | Why Needed | Result / Evidence | Cleanup Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Test-owned `mkdtemp` memory directory in `API-SC-001` | Directly observe post-diagnostic JSONL facts | Passed | `afterEach` removes registered directories |
| Live E2E suite temporary workspace/memory and child Codex client | Real current process/runtime fidelity | Passed | Suite `afterEach` closed its client/thread and removed registered directories |
| Generated shared SDK `dist/` outputs | Required for test-only cross-workspace imports | Tests passed | SDK outputs created by this run removed after final validation; pre-existing `.nuxt` and `autobyteus-ts/dist` were not treated as exclusively owned |

## Dependencies Mocked Or Emulated

| Dependency | Method | Why Real Dependency Was Not Used | Confidence Limitation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Native Codex client in `API-SC-001`/`API-SC-002` | Minimal fake request/respond object; notifications enter the real `CodexThread` handler | Deterministically producing a retry-then-recovery stream is not supported by the external provider | Exact native JSON is controlled rather than observed live; bounded by current 0.152.1 contract and retained production evidence |
| Browser network/DOM | Direct real mapper and production frontend projector in Nuxt test; separate real server WebSocket tests | No frontend production or browser-specific code changed; browser cannot induce provider retry deterministically | No pixel-level claim; lifecycle state is direct |

## Result Summary

| Result | Scenario IDs | Summary / Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Pass` | `API-SC-001`-`API-SC-007` | All planned deterministic, WebSocket, persisted-reader, static-boundary, and real Codex lifecycle checks passed. Final confidence is `96.6%`; every critical acceptance criterion has direct evidence and no category is below `90%`. |

## Cleanup Performed

| Resource / Process / Data | Ownership | Cleanup Action | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `API-SC-001` temp memory directories | Current durable test | Test `afterEach` recursive removal | `Pass`; no registered directory retained |
| Live Codex client/thread/temp directories | Current live test | Existing suite `afterEach` terminates created run/thread, closes client, removes temp dirs | `Pass`; test exited cleanly and no matching temp directory remained |
| Generated application SDK `dist/` outputs | Created by current setup | Removed only the two directories known absent before setup | `Pass` |
| Pre-existing/other Codex app-server processes | Not owned by this run | Not stopped or modified | Correctly left untouched |
| Test database under `autobyteus-server-ts/tests/.tmp` | Project test runtime | Used/reset by existing Vitest setup; no development or production database used | `Pass` |

## Preliminary Classification

`N/A` — final result is `Pass`. The initial added-test failure was a local test-fixture ordering mistake (a genuine tool boundary, not the retry diagnostic, had already closed reasoning) and was corrected without changing production code or approved behavior. The later missing-package failure was caused by invoking `prepare:shared` from the web package; the authoritative server-package command was then run and the final test passed.

## Recommended Recipient

`/code_reviewer` for proportional review of the renamed/expanded durable test only, without reopening the passed implementation source scorecard.

## Evidence / Notes

- The most direct new evidence is `API-SC-001`: an exact `willRetry: true` native error becomes turn/diagnostic evidence, leaves the same turn running and response incomplete, leaves reasoning/tool state usable, permits later raw tool output/success/reasoning/assistant content, writes those later facts to current JSONL, and ends with the same single frontend response idle/completed.
- The real Codex run did not experience a provider-stream retry. It is evidence for current external process/environment fidelity and the preserved normal path, not a false claim of live retry reproduction.
- Warnings about stale Browserslist data and KaTeX quirks mode are unchanged test-environment warnings and did not affect assertions.

## Latest Authoritative Result

- Result: `Pass`
- Final validation confidence: `96.6%`
- Default `95%` confidence target met: `Yes`
- Any final applicable confidence category below `90%`: `No`
- Broader validation decision: `Required`; executed via focused real Codex App Server lifecycle/persistence E2E; `Pass`
- Critical acceptance criteria lacking direct proof: None
- Required next recipient: `/code_reviewer` for proportional test-code review
- Notes: Repository-resident durable coverage changed, so delivery must wait for the dedicated test-code review. No production source change occurred during API/E2E.
