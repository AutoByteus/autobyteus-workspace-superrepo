## Current Implementation Summary

The implementation now distinguishes a retryable Codex provider error from a terminal turn error at the native notification boundary. Exact `willRetry === true` produces canonical turn-scoped diagnostic evidence without ending the active turn or clearing pending correlation state. Emitted errors perform effect- and scope-aware converter cleanup. Explicit late terminal boundaries for retired turn A are suppressed while turn B is active, before mutation and before local/native emission, so they cannot enter canonical, replay, wire, or frontend projection paths. No frontend production code, shared protocol, reconnect/replay logic, persistence format, or package dependency changed.

## Reviewed Behavior Implementation Trace

| Behavior ID | Approved Change / Preserved Outcome | Implemented Production Path / Key Files | Result / Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `BEH-001` | A native Codex error with exact `willRetry === true` is a turn diagnostic and must preserve the active turn plus pending reasoning/tool correlation. | `codex-thread-notification-handler.ts`; `codex-thread-lifecycle-event-converter.ts`; `codex-thread-event-converter.ts` | The handler classifies the effect without calling `markTurnFailed`; the converter recognizes a valid canonical turn diagnostic and performs no structural tracker cleanup. Focused thread, converter, reasoning, and tool-correlation regressions pass. |
| `BEH-002` | Later same-turn native events continue through the existing canonical stream, replay-capable run pipeline, wire mapper, and frontend projection. | Existing `CodexThread` listener and `CodexThreadEventConverter` pipeline is reused unchanged outside the local policy hooks; existing frontend projector remains unchanged. | Unit regressions prove later message, MCP completion, raw output, and reasoning continuation. The selected existing diagnostic WebSocket lifecycle regression passes. |
| `BEH-003` | Preserve matching terminal/global behavior while preventing explicit stale A terminal boundaries from affecting active B; emitted exact turn terminals clean only that turn. | Exact stale predicate and no-emission result in `codex-thread-notification-handler.ts`; exact-turn boundary hooks in the lifecycle/event converters. | Unit tests cover stale terminal error, completion, and failed status, matching terminal behavior, identity-missing fallback, exact-turn cleanup, and runtime-global all-scope cleanup. A joined A/B server regression and test-only native-to-live projection regression prove B continues and completes only on B's own boundary. |

## Important Assumptions

- The current Codex app-server contract expresses retry intent only through exact boolean `willRetry === true`; truthy strings or other values remain terminal.
- Only an exact, non-empty event turn identity and exact, non-empty current active turn identity may prove a stale A/B mismatch. Identity-missing events retain the existing conservative fallback behavior.
- Suppressed stale boundaries are prospective native-notification containment, not historical repair. No prior canonical or persisted events are deleted.
- The joined web regression intentionally imports server source only from test code; the web package has no production dependency on the server package.

## Known Risks

- The unchanged frontend diagnostic card can still look severe even though the run continues; this presentation risk was explicitly approved out of scope.
- A future Codex app-server retry contract change would require revisiting exact `willRetry` classification.
- Previously discarded post-diagnostic events are not reconstructed, and no persistence migration/backfill was approved.
- Full repository-wide typecheck commands currently encounter baseline configuration/dependency errors described below. The changed production source typechecks, builds, and focused tests pass.

## Task Design Health Assessment Implementation Check

- Reviewed change posture: `Bug Fix`
- Reviewed root-cause classification: `Local Implementation Defect`
- Reviewed refactor decision (`Refactor Needed Now`/`No Refactor Needed`/`Deferred`): `No Refactor Needed`
- Implementation matched the reviewed assessment (`Yes`/`No`): `Yes`
- If challenged, routed as `Design Impact` (`Yes`/`No`/`N/A`): `N/A`
- Evidence / notes: The change stays within the existing Codex notification handler and lifecycle converter, reuses the established exact-turn tracker hooks, and adds no new shared abstraction, frontend policy, or cross-backend behavior.

## Legacy / Compatibility Removal Check

- Backward-compatibility mechanisms introduced: `None`
- Legacy old-behavior retained in scope: `No`
- Dead/obsolete code, obsolete files, unused helpers/tests/flags/adapters, and dormant replaced paths removed in scope: `Yes`
- Shared structures remain tight (no one-for-all base or overlapping parallel shapes introduced): `Yes`
- Canonical shared design guidance was reapplied during implementation, and file-level design weaknesses were routed upstream when needed: `Yes`
- Changed source implementation files stayed within proactive size-pressure guardrails (`>500` avoided; `>220` assessed/acted on): `Yes`
- Notes: Effective non-empty production source lengths are 183 lines for the notification handler, 88 for the lifecycle converter, and 401 for the event converter. The production delta is 74 changed lines, below the proactive change-pressure threshold.

## Persisted Data Transition Check (When Applicable)

- Approved decision (`Not Affected`/`Directly Usable — No Migration`/`Discard or Rebuild`/`Migration Required`): `Directly Usable — No Migration`
- Design-spec decision reference: `design-spec.md`, persisted-data/runtime-history decision and `DS-005`.
- Implementation follows the approved decision without an unapproved migration or version-specific runtime fallback: `Yes`
- Direct-use evidence or discard/rebuild result, when applicable: Existing canonical event payload fields, run-event storage, and frontend projection shapes are reused. No schema, stored source, migration, compatibility reader, or backfill changed.
- Migration implementation and focused checks, only when `Migration Required`: `N/A`
- Deviation from the reviewed transition decision: `None`

## Environment Or Dependency Notes

- Ran `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` in the ticket worktree. It completed with existing warnings about missing application-devkit CLI bins.
- Ran `pnpm exec nuxi prepare` in `autobyteus-web` so Nuxt aliases/types were available to the focused integration.
- Built the shared application SDK packages and generated the server Prisma client needed by the test-only cross-workspace imports. Generated `dist/` directories were removed from the working tree after validation.
- No dependency manifest or lockfile changed.

## Local Implementation Checks Run

- **Passed:** focused server suites from `autobyteus-server-ts`:
  - `pnpm exec vitest run tests/unit/agent-execution/backends/codex/thread/codex-thread.test.ts tests/unit/agent-execution/backends/codex/events/codex-thread-event-converter.test.ts tests/unit/agent-execution/backends/codex/events/codex-tool-log-correlation.test.ts tests/unit/agent-execution/backends/codex/events/codex-reasoning-block-converter.test.ts tests/unit/agent-execution/backends/codex/codex-agent-run-backend.test.ts`
  - Result: 5 files passed, 167 tests passed. Existing warning-path tests emitted their expected warnings for missing token-usage identity and rejected inactive segments.
- **Passed:** joined native-to-live projection test from `autobyteus-web`:
  - `pnpm exec vitest run tests/integration/codex-stale-turn-boundary-projection.integration.test.ts`
  - Result: 1 file passed, 1 test passed. Non-blocking baseline warnings reported stale Browserslist data and KaTeX quirks mode.
- **Passed:** selected existing generic diagnostic WebSocket lifecycle regression from `autobyteus-web`:
  - `pnpm exec vitest run tests/integration/agent/agent-status-websocket.integration.test.ts -t "keeps diagnostic errors running"`
  - Result: 1 test passed, 6 skipped by the selection filter.
- **Passed:** server production-source typecheck: `pnpm exec tsc -p tsconfig.build.json --noEmit`.
- **Passed:** server full build: `pnpm build:full`, including built-in-agent bootstrap and sanitized smoke checks.
- **Passed:** repository web boundary guard: `pnpm guard:web-boundary`.
- **Passed:** `git diff --check`.
- **Baseline limitation, not a changed-path failure:** server `pnpm typecheck` reports `TS6059` across the existing test tree because the current config sets `rootDir` to `src` while including `tests`.
- **Baseline/environment limitation, not a changed-path failure:** `pnpm exec nuxi typecheck` in the web package fails because its npx-installed `vue-tsc` attempts a TypeScript package subpath that is not exported (`ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`).
- **Baseline limitation, not a changed-path failure:** direct web `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json` reports broad existing issues, including external server-source `noImplicitOverride` findings, missing Vue declarations/dependencies, and existing test/store type errors. The focused web regression passes; no repository-wide web typecheck pass is claimed.

## Frontend Rendered-Result Check (When Applicable)

`Not Applicable` — no rendered frontend production code, layout, styling, component, or interaction changed. The new frontend-side file is a deterministic programmatic integration test of the existing projection path, not a UI change requiring visual validation.

## Downstream Coverage Hints / Suggested Scenarios

- Investigate whether existing API/E2E coverage exercises a real or realistic Codex retry sequence where native activity continues after a retryable provider error; update durable coverage only if the current test remains stale or incomplete.
- Where an environment can provide a real Codex app-server stream, verify that exact boolean `willRetry: true` produces diagnostic evidence while later text, reasoning, tool output, completion, and run status continue normally.
- Recheck explicit stale A terminal error, turn completion, and turn-identified failed status while B is active, including the absence of stale canonical/replay/wire events and B-only completion.
- Retain checks for matching non-retryable terminal behavior, runtime-global all-scope cleanup, and identity-missing conservative handling.
- Treat any broader environment setup, API/E2E execution, and durable coverage decision as downstream `api_e2e_engineer` ownership after source review.
