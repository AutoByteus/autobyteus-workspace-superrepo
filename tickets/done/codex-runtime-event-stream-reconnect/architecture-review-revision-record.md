## Revision Entries

### ARCH-REV-001 — Initial review finds cross-turn terminal cleanup leakage

- Canonical design review report: `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/codex-runtime-event-stream-reconnect-release-v1.4.67/tickets/done/codex-runtime-event-stream-reconnect/design-review-report.md`
- Review round and trigger: Round 1; initial architecture review after the user approved the Design-ready requirements and the solution designer completed `SR-001`.
- Triggering role, report path, and finding IDs: Solution designer; no prior downstream report; finding `AR-F-001` created in this review.
- Relevant solution revision IDs: `SR-001`
- Prior authoritative decision: `N/A`
- Current authoritative decision: `Fail`
- What changed in the review result or what baseline was established: Established the first architecture-review baseline. Exact retry classification, diagnostic preservation, ownership, subsystem reuse, no-migration reasoning, and rejection of reconnect/replay/admission work are sound. The design is not ready because its terminal converter arm retains run-wide tracker cleanup for a turn-scoped late error, which can disturb newer active-turn reasoning/tool state contrary to approved `BEH-003`/`AC-005`.

#### Prior Finding Resolution

None.

- New or remaining finding IDs: `AR-F-001`
- Material classification changes: None; initial baseline. Finding classification is `Design Impact`, within approved scope, with no requirement change.
- Recommended recipient: `/solution_designer`
- Remaining risks or uncertainty: Retry-card presentation, future protocol drift, and historical non-backfill remain non-blocking approved residual risks. No material reachability uncertainty blocks the finding because the late old-turn boundary is explicitly in the approved scope.

### ARCH-REV-002 — Converter cleanup resolved; stale terminal projection remains

- Canonical design review report: `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/codex-runtime-event-stream-reconnect-release-v1.4.67/tickets/done/codex-runtime-event-stream-reconnect/design-review-report.md`
- Review round and trigger: Round 2; re-review of `SR-002` after round-1 `AR-F-001`.
- Triggering role, report path, and finding IDs: Solution designer; `solution-revision-record.md` entry `SR-002`; prior finding `AR-F-001`.
- Relevant solution revision IDs: `SR-002`
- Prior authoritative decision: `Fail`
- Current authoritative decision: `Fail`
- What changed in the review result or what baseline was established: The revised `DS-004` now correctly scopes valid turn-terminal reasoning/tool cleanup to the identified turn and retains all-scope cleanup only for runtime-global or unclassified/invalid errors. Continuing the same approved late-A/active-B path through `DS-002` exposed a remaining user-visible contradiction: the canonical event is streamed with A identity, but current frontend terminal handlers ignore identity and complete/terminalize the latest B message. New `AR-F-002` records that design impact.

#### Prior Finding Resolution

| Finding ID | Prior Status | Current Status | Related Revision References | Verification Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `AR-F-001` | Open / blocking `Design Impact` | Resolved | `SR-002`; `ARCH-REV-001` | Revised `DS-004`, lifecycle-context mapping, dependency/interface rules, file mapping, examples, sequence steps 4–6, and implementation guidance explicitly validate canonical evidence and use existing `closeReasoningBlocksForBoundary` / `clearOrderedToolsForBoundary` for valid turn-terminal errors. The joined one-converter A-late/B-active test proves both B reasoning and ordered-tool correlation survive until B's own boundaries. |

- New or remaining finding IDs: `AR-F-002`
- Material classification changes: `AR-F-001` resolved. `AR-F-002` is a new within-scope `Design Impact`; no requirements or approval change is needed.
- Recommended recipient: `/solution_designer`
- Remaining risks or uncertainty: Non-blocking residual risks remain retry-card presentation, future protocol drift, and historical non-backfill. No material reachability uncertainty applies because the stale old-turn terminal/completion path is explicitly approved by `UC-003`/`AC-005` and verified through current code.

### ARCH-REV-003 — Stale projection containment resolves the remaining design impact

- Canonical design review report: `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/codex-runtime-event-stream-reconnect-release-v1.4.67/tickets/done/codex-runtime-event-stream-reconnect/design-review-report.md`
- Review round and trigger: Round 3; re-review of `SR-003` after round-2 `AR-F-002`.
- Triggering role, report path, and finding IDs: Solution designer; `solution-revision-record.md` entry `SR-003`; prior finding `AR-F-002`.
- Relevant solution revision IDs: `SR-003` (with accepted `SR-002` cleanup design retained)
- Prior authoritative decision: `Fail`
- Current authoritative decision: `Pass`
- What changed in the review result or what baseline was established: `SR-003` closes the remaining approved `UC-003` return-path contradiction at the existing `CodexThread` notification boundary. A terminal native error, completion, or turn-identified failed status is stale only when its exact non-empty event turn differs from the exact non-empty current active turn. The handler then performs no mutation and emits neither a local-derived nor native thread event, so no converter, lifecycle/replay, wire, or frontend projection can misapply A to B. Matching-active, runtime-global, identity-missing conservative, and retry-diagnostic behavior remain on their established paths. The joined native-to-live-projection test design proves the full B outcome without adding production frontend dependencies or reconnect/replay machinery.

#### Prior Finding Resolution

| Finding ID | Prior Status | Current Status | Related Revision References | Verification Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `AR-F-001` | Resolved in `ARCH-REV-002` | Resolved / confirmed | `SR-002`; `ARCH-REV-001`; `ARCH-REV-002`; retained by `SR-003` | Current `DS-004`, lifecycle-context mapping, dependency/interface rules, change sequence, and implementation guidance still require no cleanup for valid turn diagnostics, exact-turn cleanup for emitted valid turn terminals, and all-scope cleanup only for runtime-global or genuinely unclassified errors. The one-instance A/B regression still proves B reasoning and ordered-tool correlation survive until B's own boundaries. |
| `AR-F-002` | Open / blocking `Design Impact` | Resolved | `SR-003`; `ARCH-REV-002` | Revised `DS-002`/`DS-003` define the exact A/B stale predicate before mutation/emission, reuse the existing empty-events plus `emitNativeMessage: false` result, prohibit downstream reconstruction, and specify that no canonical/replay/wire/UI A event exists. Unit coverage spans stale terminal error, completion, and turn-identified failed status; the joined real-owner integration drives B content/tool state through both A facts and proves one B response completes only on B's boundary. |

- New or remaining finding IDs: None.
- Material classification changes: `AR-F-002` resolved; no current `Design Impact`, `Requirement Gap`, or `Unclear` finding remains. The authoritative decision changes from `Fail` to `Pass`.
- Recommended recipient: `/implementation_engineer`
- Remaining risks or uncertainty: Retry-card presentation, future protocol drift, historical non-backfill, and conservative identity-missing handling remain non-blocking. The test-only cross-workspace integration may require explicit dependency setup, but the design forbids resolving that by creating a web production dependency. No material reachability uncertainty remains.
