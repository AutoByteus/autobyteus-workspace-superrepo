## Revision Entries

### DR-001 — Integrated Gemini 3.8 user-verification candidate

- Delivery round and trigger: Initial delivery round after Code Reviewer returned `CRR-002 Pass` for package `PKG-GEMINI-3-8-FLASH-2026-09-03`.
- Triggering upstream report, verification, or evidence: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/gemini-3-8-flash/api-e2e-test-review-report.md`; `API-REV-001 Pass / 96.8%`; `CRR-001` and `CRR-002` Pass.
- Prior authoritative result (`N/A` for `DR-001`): `N/A`
- Current authoritative result: `Pass — latest-base integrated, post-integration checks passed, long-lived docs synchronized, release notes prepared, and the candidate is held for explicit user verification.`
- Docs sync report: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/gemini-3-8-flash/docs-sync-report.md`
- Handoff summary: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/gemini-3-8-flash/handoff-summary.md`
- Release/publication/deployment report: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/gemini-3-8-flash/release-deployment-report.md`
- Integration and post-integration verification: Protected the reviewed candidate at `37cc33c5e`, merged `origin/personal@1ab6d38af` as `554197f778`, then passed core 33/33, server/shared build and bootstrap smoke, server 22/22, and diff hygiene. Evidence: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/gemini-3-8-flash/delivery-evidence/initial-integration-verification.log`.
- User verification/finalization state: Explicit verification not yet received. No archive, push, target merge, version bump, tag, publication, deployment, or ticket-worktree cleanup was performed.
- Terminal return to `/requirements_engineer`: `Not yet eligible`
- Terminal return message/reference: `N/A`
- Why this baseline or delivery revision was recorded: This is the first completed delivery-stage result; no prior delivery record existed and none was inferred. It establishes the integrated, documented candidate and the exact remaining user/finalization gates.
- Next recipient/action: User verification. After an explicit response, Delivery will refresh the target, finalize, execute any authorized release path, clean up safely, append `DR-002`, and apply dynamic terminal handoff rules.
- Remaining blockers, rollback concerns, or untested scope: No task defect is open. Credentialed Google response success remains unobserved because two approved key capabilities were absent. The unrelated full-server E2E baseline remains recorded. Before finalization, rollback is simply to withhold all publication actions.

### DR-002 — Linux ARM64 Electron artifact for user testing

- Delivery round and trigger: Delivery continuation after the user requested, "read the readme, and build the electron so i could test".
- Triggering upstream report, verification, or evidence: User testing request following `DR-001`; root `README.md` and `autobyteus-web/README.md` desktop build guidance.
- Prior authoritative result (`N/A` for `DR-001`): `DR-001 Pass — integrated user-verification candidate`
- Current authoritative result: `Pass — the documented current-host Electron build completed and produced an executable Linux ARM64 AppImage for user testing.`
- Docs sync report: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/gemini-3-8-flash/docs-sync-report.md` (`No delivery-doc delta required`)
- Handoff summary: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/gemini-3-8-flash/handoff-summary.md`
- Release/publication/deployment report: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/gemini-3-8-flash/release-deployment-report.md`
- Integration and post-integration verification: Refetched `origin/personal`; it remained `1ab6d38af5688103f6c57bea323074d3c2299ca1`, so no reintegration was needed. `corepack pnpm build:electron:linux` passed on Linux ARM64 at ticket head `554197f7782c7319cfdcdbfea4cbfc9c76d5b2b6`.
- User verification/finalization state: Test artifact is ready; explicit test completion is still pending. No archival, push, target merge, release, publication, or deployment occurred.
- Terminal return to `/requirements_engineer`: `Not yet eligible`
- Terminal return message/reference: `N/A`
- Why this baseline or delivery revision was recorded: The user requested a new delivery-owned verification artifact after DR-001. The completed build materially changes the user-verification package and must be durably recorded.
- Next recipient/action: User tests `/home/autobyteus/workspace/.codex/worktrees/gemini-3-8-flash/autobyteus-web/electron-dist/AutoByteus_enterprise_linux-arm64-1.4.67.AppImage` and reports pass/fail plus finalization/release instruction.
- Remaining blockers, rollback concerns, or untested scope: The AppImage was built but not claimed as user-tested. Credentialed Google response success remains subject to the already recorded access limitation. The build artifact is local and has not been published.

### DR-003 — Electron app opened for hands-on verification

- Delivery round and trigger: Delivery continuation after the user requested that the built Electron app be opened for testing.
- Triggering upstream report, verification, or evidence: User launch request after `DR-002` produced the Linux ARM64 AppImage.
- Prior authoritative result (`N/A` for `DR-001`): `DR-002 Pass — Linux ARM64 Electron test artifact prepared`
- Current authoritative result: `Pass — the Electron window is open, the built-in server is ready, and user testing is in progress.`
- Docs sync report: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/gemini-3-8-flash/docs-sync-report.md` (`No documentation delta`)
- Handoff summary: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/gemini-3-8-flash/handoff-summary.md`
- Release/publication/deployment report: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/gemini-3-8-flash/release-deployment-report.md`
- Integration and post-integration verification: The AppImage wrapper failed before application start because the container lacks unversioned `libz.so`. Delivery launched the same package's `linux-arm64-unpacked/autobyteus` executable with `--no-sandbox`, required only because this test container runs as root. The `autobyteus` window is present and `http://127.0.0.1:29695/rest/health` returns healthy.
- User verification/finalization state: Hands-on testing is active; no pass/fail user verdict has been received. Repository finalization and release remain on hold.
- Terminal return to `/requirements_engineer`: `Not yet eligible`
- Terminal return message/reference: `N/A`
- Why this baseline or delivery revision was recorded: Opening the app converted the prepared artifact into an active user-verification session, including one host-specific launch fallback that must remain visible.
- Next recipient/action: User tests Gemini 3.8 in the open application and reports pass/fail plus finalization/release instruction.
- Remaining blockers, rollback concerns, or untested scope: The AppImage wrapper cannot directly start on this container without an unversioned `libz.so`; the unpacked application is running correctly. This does not establish portability to a separate host. Credentialed Gemini success remains unclaimed until exercised by the user or configured test access.

### DR-004 — User-verified finalization and v1.4.68 release

- Delivery round and trigger: Delivery continuation after the user confirmed, `"i have tested. its working. lets finalize and release a new version"`.
- Triggering upstream report, verification, or evidence: `DR-003`; explicit user acceptance on 2026-09-03; unchanged post-verification `origin/personal` refresh.
- Prior authoritative result (`N/A` for `DR-001`): `DR-003 Pass — Electron window and bundled backend running for user test`
- Current authoritative result: `Pass — the ticket is archived, the ticket and target branches were finalized and pushed, v1.4.68 was tagged and published, and all applicable release/deployment workflows and outputs were verified.`
- Docs sync report: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/gemini-3-8-flash/docs-sync-report.md` (`No new long-lived docs delta; release-state artifacts updated`)
- Handoff summary: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/gemini-3-8-flash/handoff-summary.md`
- Release/publication/deployment report: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/gemini-3-8-flash/release-deployment-report.md`
- Integration and post-integration verification: No new target commit existed after user verification, so no renewed integration or user verification was required. Ticket commit `7276a5821` was pushed, merged to `personal` as `cd245ee78`, and released as commit `d9b63778d` with annotated tag `v1.4.68`.
- User verification/finalization state: `User verification Passed; repository finalization Completed; release and rollout Completed.` The public GitHub Release contains 21 assets. Desktop, Android, iOS App Store Connect, Messaging Gateway, and Server Docker workflows all completed successfully at the exact release commit. Docker versioned/latest tags and updater/release metadata were verified.
- Terminal return to Requirements Engineer: `Not yet eligible — safe cleanup remains`
- Terminal return message/reference: `N/A`
- Why this delivery revision was recorded: Explicit user acceptance authorized irreversible finalization and publication. The completed repository and release result is materially distinct from the active user-test state in DR-003 and must remain auditable before cleanup.
- Next recipient/action: Delivery commits/pushes authoritative release evidence, removes/prunes the dedicated worktree, deletes the merged local and remote ticket branches, verifies the clean target state, and appends the terminal revision before dynamic handoff.
- Remaining blockers, rollback concerns, or untested scope: No task or rollout blocker remains. Cleanup is pending. Automated credentialed Google response success was not claimed because approved test credentials were unavailable; the user's separate hands-on acceptance is recorded. Correct any later public defect with a new patch rather than rewriting `v1.4.68`.

### DR-005 — Safe cleanup and terminal readiness

- Delivery round and trigger: Delivery continuation after DR-004 release evidence was committed to `personal` as `806c469df956c7f66c46b05e93e19fac2c06647a` and pushed successfully.
- Triggering upstream report, verification, or evidence: `DR-004 Pass`; verified public `v1.4.68` outputs made post-finalization cleanup safe.
- Prior authoritative result (`N/A` for `DR-001`): `DR-004 Pass — repository finalized and v1.4.68 rollout verified`
- Current authoritative result: `Delivery Completed — the dedicated ticket worktree was removed and pruned, merged local and remote ticket branches were deleted, the finalization target remained clean and remote-aligned, and every terminal gate is satisfied.`
- Docs sync report: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/gemini-3-8-flash/docs-sync-report.md` (`No new long-lived docs delta; terminal delivery records updated`)
- Handoff summary: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/gemini-3-8-flash/handoff-summary.md`
- Release/publication/deployment report: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/autobyteus-workspace/tickets/done/gemini-3-8-flash/release-deployment-report.md`
- Integration and post-integration verification: `N/A — no code or base integration changed after the user-verified release.` Release evidence commit `806c469df` was pushed before cleanup; the final terminal documentation commit and exact remote ref are verified immediately before dynamic handoff.
- User verification/finalization state: `User verification Passed; repository finalization Completed; v1.4.68 release/rollout Completed; safe cleanup Completed.`
- Terminal return to Requirements Engineer: `Eligible — dynamic rule lookup and exact-recipient message follow final commit/push verification`
- Terminal return message/reference: `Pending dynamic handoff at artifact-write time`
- Why this delivery revision was recorded: Cleanup is a mandatory delivery gate and materially changes the result from release-complete-but-not-terminal in DR-004 to fully terminal-ready.
- Next recipient/action: Resolve the `Delivery Completed` handoff rule and send the authoritative cumulative completion package to its exact recipient.
- Remaining blockers, rollback concerns, or untested scope: No blocker remains. The previously recorded automated credential limitation and unrelated full-server E2E baseline remain truthful residual context, not package findings. Any public regression requires a later corrective patch; do not rewrite stable tag `v1.4.68`.
