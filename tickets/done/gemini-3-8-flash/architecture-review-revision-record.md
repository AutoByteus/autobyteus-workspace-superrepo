## Revision Entries

### ARCH-REV-001 — Initial architecture review pass

- Canonical design review report: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/.codex/worktrees/gemini-3-8-flash/tickets/done/gemini-3-8-flash/design-review-report.md`
- Review round and trigger: Round 1; Architecture Designer completed `AD-REV-001` and selected independent Architecture Review because the external Gemini 3.8 request contract changes inside a shared adapter.
- Triggering role, report path, and finding IDs: Architecture Designer; `/home/autobyteus/workspace/.codex/worktrees/gemini-3-8-flash/tickets/done/gemini-3-8-flash/design-spec.md`; no triggering finding IDs.
- Relevant architecture design revision IDs: `AD-REV-001`
- Prior authoritative decision: `N/A`
- Current authoritative decision: `Pass`
- What changed in the review result or what baseline was established: Established the initial independent-review baseline. RER-002 behavior and production paths are confirmed; the design is actionable, preserves coherent existing owners, isolates exact 3.8 request policy from current 3.1 Pro, uses existing observation-time pricing and current-selection/history boundaries, and requires no persistence migration.

#### Prior Finding Resolution

None.

- New or remaining finding IDs: None.
- Material classification changes: None; preserve `task_size=Medium`, `architectural_risk=High`, and the architecture route.
- Recommended recipient: Primary pass handoff to `/software_engineering_team/implementation_engineer`; informational pass notification to `/software_engineering_team/architecture_designer`, subject to exact dynamic handoff-rule recipients.
- Remaining risks or uncertainty: Dependency setup in the isolated worktree; a narrow Google SDK lower-case typing seam; live credential/entitlement/quota/region availability; and complete classification of any remaining active 3.7 reference. These are downstream implementation/validation risks with explicit design mitigations, not architecture blockers.
