## Current Implementation Summary

The built-in Gemini Flash catalog and runtime mapping now use exact `gemini-3.8-flash` identity with no 3.7 alias. The catalog carries verified 3.8 limits, introductory flat prices, and two fixed observation-time price schedules. `GeminiLLM` dispatches on exact model value: 3.8 requests use lower-case string `thinkingLevel`, retain thought-summary control, filter every approved forbidden field and caller override of adapter-owned thinking/tools/abort values, and share that builder across send and stream. The non-3.8 path retains the prior 3.1 Pro thinking-budget, sampling, penalty, tools, and extra-param behavior. Focused catalog, request-boundary, mapping, continuation, pricing, stale-selection, and historical-display coverage was added or updated. The active Gemini LLM live scenario values and server metadata assertion now target 3.8.

## Routing Classification (Mandatory)

- Task size (`Small`/`Medium`/`Large`): `Medium`
- Architecture risk (`Low`/`High`): `High`
- Requirements routing assessment path: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/.codex/worktrees/gemini-3-8-flash/tickets/done/gemini-3-8-flash/requirements-doc.md`, section `Architecture Design Routing Assessment`
- Classification confirmed or changed: `Confirmed`
- Evidence and rationale for confirmation or change: The completed delta remains bounded to three production files under existing catalog, adapter, and runtime-mapping owners plus focused validation fixtures. No new public API, persistence schema, UI surface, deployment unit, dependency version, or ownership boundary was introduced. Risk remains High because the shared provider adapter now enforces an external 3.8 wire contract while preserving the separately current 3.1 Pro contract, and live provider access is still unverified.
- Selected route (`Direct API/E2E`/`Code Review`/`Architecture Designer`): `Code Review`
- Lightweight implementation self-review completed for the direct route: `Not Applicable` — the confirmed High-risk architecture route requires independent source review.
- New design impact or escalation trigger: `None`

## Reviewed Behavior Implementation Trace

| Behavior ID | Approved Change / Preserved Outcome | Implemented Production Path / Key Files | Result / Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BEH-001 | Expose exact current 3.8 catalog identity/schema/metadata and remove current 3.7. | `autobyteus-ts/src/llm/supported-model-definitions.ts` -> existing `LLMFactory`/server/GraphQL/web projection; catalog and metadata assertions updated. | Exact name/value/canonical/model identifier is 3.8; shared low/medium/high, default-medium and include-thoughts schema retained; current 3.7 row absent. |
| BEH-002 | Invoke 3.8 through existing modes with level-based allowed config while preserving supported response/media/tool/error paths and other Gemini models. | `autobyteus-ts/src/llm/api/gemini-llm.ts`; `autobyteus-ts/src/utils/gemini-model-mapping.ts`; focused `gemini-llm.test.ts`; provider-native continuation test. | Exact 3.8 branch owns final thinking/tools/abort fields, omits all approved sampling/penalty/count/budget forms from common config and extras, uses the same builder for send/stream, and keeps 3.1 budget/sampling behavior. Lower-case SDK type mismatch is isolated to one `unknown as ThinkingConfig` boundary cast. |
| BEH-003 | Reject stale 3.7 without alias/rewrite while retaining historical identity. | 3.7 catalog/map removal; `supported-model-definitions.test.ts` exact current-membership assertion; historical projection assertion in `token-usage-model-display-projection.test.ts`. | 3.8 resolves, 3.7 raises the existing typed current-selection error, and stored historical 3.7 display remains truthful. No migration or runtime fallback was added. |
| BEH-004 | Price 3.8 by observation time across introductory and 2027 standard periods without altering old records. | Catalog `pricingScheduleHistory` -> existing `TokenPriceConfigProvider` selector; boundary tests in `token-price-config-provider.test.ts`. | Two fixed schedules select `$0.75/$3.75/$0.075` through the final 2026 instant and `$1.50/$7.50/$0.15` at 2027-01-01; schedule/period IDs and trusted dimensions are asserted; invalid time still fails closed. |
| BEH-005 | Make active validation fixtures/assertions target 3.8 while preserving truthful gated live behavior. | Core catalog/adapter/mapping/native-payload tests; server metadata/pricing/history tests; `test-support/live-e2e/live-e2e-scenarios.mjs`. | Deterministic implementation checks passed. Broader server API/E2E and credential-gated live execution remain owned by API/E2E. Current documentation sync remains owned by Delivery. |

## Important Assumptions

- RER-002 and AD-REV-001 remain authoritative: 3.8 is the sole current Gemini Flash text row, and no 3.7 alias, silent rewrite, or history migration is permitted.
- The existing runtime resolver remains authoritative for AI Studio, Vertex Express, and Vertex Project; both Vertex modes normalize to `vertex`, and the provider model value is exact 3.8 in both normalized runtime mappings.
- Google's approved JavaScript wire value remains lower-case even though resolved `@google/genai` 1.42.0 exposes an upper-case `ThinkingLevel` enum in its generate-content type. The implementation preserves the lower-case wire contract through a narrow adapter-local cast.
- Delivery owns synchronization of the three current-product documentation files that still describe 3.7 as current.

## Known Risks

- Live Gemini 3.8 success still depends on credentials, entitlement, quota, region, and project setup; no live success is claimed here.
- Broader server API/E2E execution, safe provider-error regressions, and live-provider validation have not been performed at this stage.
- Three active documentation files still contain current 3.7 prose and require Delivery-owned synchronization: `provider-error-and-pricing-contract.md`, `autobyteus-ts/docs/provider_model_catalogs.md`, and `autobyteus-server-ts/docs/modules/llm_management.md`.
- The repository-wide server `typecheck` script reaches TypeScript but fails on the existing `rootDir=src` plus `include=tests` configuration with TS6059 for many unchanged test files; focused changed tests and the core package build pass.
- The full `autobyteus-ts` unit run exposed three unrelated image-client expectation failures in unchanged source/tests and retained open handles until interrupted. The focused Gemini/catalog/mapping/continuation suite passes independently.

## Task Design Health Assessment Implementation Check

- Reviewed change posture: `Behavior Change` with a clean-cut catalog replacement.
- Reviewed root-cause classification: `Shared Structure Looseness` in the shared Gemini generation-config assumption.
- Reviewed refactor decision (`Refactor Needed Now`/`No Refactor Needed`/`Deferred`): `Refactor Needed Now`
- Implementation matched the reviewed assessment (`Yes`/`No`): `Yes`
- If challenged, routed as `Design Impact` (`Yes`/`No`/`N/A`): `N/A`
- Evidence / notes: The exact-model split stays private to `GeminiLLM`; callers, shared `LLMModel`, renderer, authentication/runtime selection, pricing selector, persistence, and UI boundaries remain unchanged. Both send and stream reuse the same builder.

## Legacy / Compatibility Removal Check

- Backward-compatibility mechanisms introduced: `None`
- Legacy old-behavior retained in scope: `No`
- Dead/obsolete code, obsolete files, unused helpers/tests/flags/adapters, and dormant replaced paths removed in scope: `Yes` — the current 3.7 row and explicit runtime-map row were replaced, not duplicated; current validation/live targets now use 3.8. Explicit stale/history assertions remain intentionally.
- Shared structures remain tight (no one-for-all base or overlapping parallel shapes introduced): `Yes`
- Canonical shared design guidance was reapplied during implementation, and file-level design weaknesses were routed upstream when needed: `Yes`
- Changed source implementation files stayed within proactive size-pressure guardrails (`>500` avoided; `>220` assessed/acted on): `Yes` — the largest changed source file has 485 effective non-empty lines; source deltas are 43, 15, and 3 added lines respectively.
- Notes: The separately current 3.1 Pro budget branch is preserved behavior, not compatibility for removed 3.7. No alias, migration, dual row, or historical pricing fallback exists.

## Persisted Data Transition Check (When Applicable)

- Approved decision (`Not Affected`/`Directly Usable — No Migration`/`Discard or Rebuild`/`Migration Required`): `Directly Usable — No Migration`
- Design-spec decision reference: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/.codex/worktrees/gemini-3-8-flash/tickets/done/gemini-3-8-flash/design-spec.md`, section `Persisted Data / State Transition Decision`
- Implementation follows the approved decision without an unapproved migration or version-specific runtime fallback: `Yes`
- Direct-use evidence or discard/rebuild result, when applicable: Exact current-membership validation rejects 3.7; historical display continues to use stored provider/model identity and was covered with an explicit 3.7 event assertion. No persistence source or schema changed.
- Migration implementation and focused checks, only when `Migration Required`: `N/A`
- Deviation from the reviewed transition decision: `None`

## Environment Or Dependency Notes

- `corepack pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` completed successfully. It emitted only existing application-devkit bin warnings before dependent packages were built.
- The installed dependency is `@google/genai` 1.42.0 from the existing root lockfile; manifest and lockfiles were not modified.
- The installed SDK contains `ThinkingConfig.thinkingLevel` but its generated enum values are upper-case. The official lower-case 3.8 value is retained with one narrow adapter-local typing seam and captured request tests.
- `corepack enable` was needed so package scripts that invoke nested `pnpm` could run in this shell.

## Local Implementation Checks Run

- `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` — passed; no lockfile change.
- `pnpm -C autobyteus-ts exec vitest run tests/unit/llm/api/gemini-llm.test.ts tests/unit/llm/supported-model-definitions.test.ts tests/unit/utils/gemini-model-mapping.test.ts tests/unit/llm/api/provider-native-request-payloads.test.ts --no-watch` — passed: 4 files, 38 tests.
- `pnpm --filter autobyteus-ts build` — passed, including runtime dependency verification.
- `pnpm -C autobyteus-server-ts exec vitest run tests/unit/token-usage/pricing/token-price-config-provider.test.ts tests/unit/token-usage/projections/token-usage-model-display-projection.test.ts --no-watch` — passed: 2 files, 17 tests.
- Final catalog-only recheck after the exact-one-row assertion — passed: 1 file, 6 tests.
- `git diff --check` and lockfile-diff check — passed.
- Repository-wide `pnpm --filter autobyteus-server-ts typecheck` — blocked by existing TS6059 configuration errors because `tsconfig.json` sets `rootDir` to `src` while including all `tests`; the shared dependency builds that precede it passed.
- Full `autobyteus-ts` unit run — task-relevant tests passed, but the run exposed 3 unrelated failures in unchanged image-client tests and retained open handles until interrupted. A focused rerun confirmed those failures are expectation drift around added SDK/options arguments in `openai-image-client.test.ts` and `autobyteus-image-client.test.ts`.

These are implementation-scoped checks only, not API/E2E sign-off.

## Frontend Rendered-Result Check (When Applicable)

`Not Applicable` — no rendered frontend or interaction code changed. The existing schema-driven selector consumes the catalog generically; independent server catalog projection and eventual delivery verification remain downstream work.

## Downstream Coverage Hints / Suggested Scenarios

- Independently inspect final `generateContent` and `generateContentStream` payloads for 3.8 across `api_key` and `vertex`, including common and extra-param attempts to reintroduce every forbidden camel/snake key.
- Confirm AI Studio, Vertex Express, and Vertex Project client construction remains distinct while each request targets exact `gemini-3.8-flash`.
- Execute the server metadata GraphQL E2E matrix and assert zero Gemini credential resolution and zero metadata HTTP requests in all three modes.
- Revalidate stale 3.7 launch/readiness behavior through the application boundary and historical 3.7 run/token display without mutation.
- Exercise 2026-12-31T23:59:59.999Z, 2027-01-01T00:00:00.000Z, and invalid observation times through pricing policy/cost evidence.
- Run the credential-gated 3.8 live scenario in any configured supported mode and report credential/entitlement/quota/region blockers truthfully without secrets.
- Delivery should replace only current 3.7 documentation claims, retaining explicit stale-selection/historical references and all archived evidence.

## API / E2E / Executable Coverage Investigation And Execution Still Required

Yes. API/E2E owns broader server/API execution, live-provider validation, residual failure classification, and durable validation evidence. Delivery owns final documentation sync and user-facing verification. The implementation remains on the confirmed `Medium` / `High` route and therefore requires independent Code Review first.
