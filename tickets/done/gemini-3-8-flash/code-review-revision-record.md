# Code Review Revision Record

The latest `/home/autobyteus/workspace/.codex/worktrees/gemini-3-8-flash/tickets/done/gemini-3-8-flash/code-review-report.md` remains authoritative for the current source-review result. This record is the concise chronological history for implementation, failure-origin, and proportional test-review results.

## Revision Entries

### CRR-001 — Initial Gemini 3.8 implementation source-review pass

- Canonical review report updated: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/.codex/worktrees/gemini-3-8-flash/tickets/done/gemini-3-8-flash/code-review-report.md`
- Review entry point and round: `Implementation Review`, Round 1.
- Triggering role, report path, and finding or scenario IDs: Implementation Engineer; `/home/autobyteus/workspace/.codex/worktrees/gemini-3-8-flash/tickets/done/gemini-3-8-flash/implementation-handoff.md`; `BEH-001`–`BEH-005`, `SCN-001`–`SCN-006`; no triggering finding IDs.
- Relevant architecture design revision IDs: `AD-REV-001`
- Relevant architecture-review revision IDs: `ARCH-REV-001`
- Relevant implementation revision IDs: `IR-001`
- Relevant API/E2E revision IDs: `N/A`
- Relevant delivery revision IDs: `N/A`
- Prior authoritative result: `N/A`
- Current authoritative result: `Pass` — exact current 3.8 catalog/runtime identity, adapter-owned level-based request construction, preserved 3.1 behavior, observation-time pricing schedules, and clean stale/history separation conform to the approved package; no source finding is open.
- What changed in the review result and why: Established the initial independent code-review baseline after the High-risk implementation route. The full artifact chain, production diff, relevant current paths, SDK converter behavior, source-size pressure, legacy/cleanup state, and focused executable evidence were independently reviewed. Reviewer checks passed 38 core tests, the core build/runtime-dependency verification, and 17 server pricing/history tests.
- Supported product scenario / material-premise basis changes: None. SCN-001–SCN-006 remain supported and confirmed. Architecture premise `MP-001` remains confirmed as not reachable through a supported product path and did not drive any machinery, finding, score deduction, or routing.

#### Prior Finding Resolution

None.

- New or remaining finding IDs: None.
- Material score or classification changes: Initial score baseline `9.5/10` (`94.7/100`); `task_size=Medium` and `architectural_risk=High` are confirmed unchanged; review decision `Pass`.
- Recommended recipient: Primary dynamic pass route to `/software_engineering_team/api_e2e_engineer`; informational pass notification to `/software_engineering_team/implementation_engineer` after primary handoff succeeds.
- Remaining risks or uncertainty: Broader server API/E2E and credential-gated live execution; narrow lower-case SDK typing seam; three Delivery-owned current-doc updates; unrelated pre-existing server typecheck and full-core baseline failures.

### CRR-002 — Gemini 3.8 durable API/E2E test-code review pass

- Canonical review report updated: `/home/autobyteus/workspace/.codex/worktrees/gemini-3-8-flash/tickets/done/gemini-3-8-flash/api-e2e-test-review-report.md`
- Review entry point and round: `Successful API/E2E Test-Code Review`, Round 1.
- Triggering role, report path, and finding or scenario IDs: API/E2E Engineer; `/home/autobyteus/workspace/.codex/worktrees/gemini-3-8-flash/tickets/done/gemini-3-8-flash/api-e2e-execution-coverage-report.md`; `SCN-001`, `SCN-002`, `SCN-004`, `SCN-005`, `SCN-006`; no task-scoped API/E2E failure ID.
- Relevant architecture design revision IDs: `AD-REV-001`
- Relevant architecture-review revision IDs: `ARCH-REV-001`
- Relevant implementation revision IDs: `IR-001`
- Relevant API/E2E revision IDs: `API-REV-001`
- Relevant delivery revision IDs: `N/A`
- Prior authoritative result: `Pass` — `CRR-001` implementation source review; no source finding open.
- Current authoritative result: `Pass` — the two added and two updated durable test paths are clear, requirement-aligned, appropriately isolated, coherent, and consistent with the successful API/E2E evidence; no test-code finding is open.
- What changed in the review result and why: Completed the required proportional review after `API-REV-001` passed at `96.8%`. Reviewed the installed-SDK wire contract, built-server catalog projection, exact stale-selection regression, and historical analytics regression. No durable test was removed. Per the bounded review contract, the successful API/E2E workflow was not rerun.
- Supported product scenario / material-premise basis changes: None. Approved `RER-002` scenarios remain the independent basis; the changed callers and fixtures exercise that basis rather than establish it.

#### Prior Finding Resolution

None.

- New or remaining finding IDs: None.
- Material score or classification changes: The implementation source-review score is not repeated or changed. `API-REV-001`'s `96.8%` validation confidence is accepted as execution context; `task_size=Medium` and `architectural_risk=High` remain unchanged; proportional test-review decision `Pass`.
- Recommended recipient: Dynamic successful test-review route to `/software_engineering_team/delivery_engineer` with the complete passed package.
- Remaining risks or uncertainty: Credentialed AI Studio and Vertex Express operations remain blocked by missing approved test-vault capabilities (`API-E2E-007-ACCESS-001`); unrelated full-server baseline failures remain recorded as `API-E2E-004-BL-001`; three current documentation files remain Delivery-owned for synchronization.
