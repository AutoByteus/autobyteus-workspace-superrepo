- Delivery Revision Record Reviewed As Context (delivery re-entry only): `N/A — initial delivery entry follows this review`
- API/E2E Result: `Pass`
- Final Validation Confidence: `96.8%`
- Prior unresolved test-review findings rechecked: `None — this is the initial proportional durable-test review.`
- Supported Product Scenario Basis Confirmed: `Yes` — the changed tests reproduce approved `SCN-001`, `SCN-002`, `SCN-004`, `SCN-005`, and `SCN-006` behavior from `RER-002`; no test caller or synthetic fixture is used to create its own product-scenario basis.

## Changed Durable Test Scope

Temporary probes, logs, generated coverage, and execution-only artifacts were treated as evidence, not durable test code.

| Durable Test Path | Change (`Added`/`Updated`/`Removed`) | Related Scenario / Requirement | Coherent Test Responsibility | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/home/autobyteus/workspace/.codex/worktrees/gemini-3-8-flash/autobyteus-ts/tests/integration/llm/api/gemini-llm-wire-contract.test.ts` | Added | `SCN-002`, `SCN-006`; `REQ-003`, `REQ-005`, `REQ-010`, `REQ-013`; `AC-003`, `AC-009`, `AC-011` | Actual installed Google SDK HTTP serialization, safe provider-error evidence, and stable missing-key behavior | Three focused cases use a local loopback server and production adapter/error paths. |
| `/home/autobyteus/workspace/.codex/worktrees/gemini-3-8-flash/autobyteus-server-ts/tests/e2e/llm-management/gemini-3-8-catalog-http.e2e.test.ts` | Added | `SCN-001`; `REQ-001`, `REQ-002`, `REQ-004`, `REQ-007`, `REQ-009`; `AC-001`, `AC-002`, `AC-008` | Built-server GraphQL projection of the exact current Gemini Flash catalog row | Uses an owned server, unique runtime, and isolated database. |
| `/home/autobyteus/workspace/.codex/worktrees/gemini-3-8-flash/autobyteus-server-ts/tests/unit/application-platform/application-launch-host-capability-validator.test.ts` | Updated | `SCN-004`; `REQ-002`, `REQ-011`; `AC-006` | Exact stale Gemini 3.7 selection rejection through production current-model membership | The exact regression complements rather than duplicates the existing generic removed-model case. |
| `/home/autobyteus/workspace/.codex/worktrees/gemini-3-8-flash/autobyteus-server-ts/tests/e2e/token-usage/token-usage-analytics-graphql.e2e.test.ts` | Updated | `SCN-004`, `SCN-005`; `REQ-011`; `AC-006` | Stored historical Gemini 3.7 identity and cost preservation across SQL-to-GraphQL projection | Inserts and cleans its owned history record and proves exact stored values. |

- No durable test file changed: `No`
- Review result when no durable test file changed: `N/A`

## Proportional Test-Code Checks

No implementation-source line limits, delta thresholds, source-review score categories, or forced file splitting were applied.

| Check | Result (`Pass`/`Fail`/`N/A`) | Evidence / Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scenario grouping and names make intent clear | Pass | Each added or updated case names the supported behavior and boundary: installed-SDK wire contract, built-server catalog projection, stale current selection, or immutable historical analytics. |
| Assertions prove approved requirements instead of incidental implementation details | Pass | Assertions cover the exact model identity and endpoint, lower-case `thinkingLevel`, forbidden-field absence, safe error redaction, catalog row/schema and 3.7 absence, early stale-selection rejection, and exact stored historical identity/cost. These are approved external or lifecycle contracts. |
| Fixtures, setup, helpers, and data builders reuse meaningful repetition | Pass | The changes reuse the core Gemini test bootstrap and error extractor, server live-test/runtime helpers, production `LLMFactory`, configuration/credential helpers, Prisma client, and existing token-usage builders where appropriate. Local helpers are limited to the boundary-specific setup. |
| Test isolation and determinism are appropriate for the exercised boundary | Pass | The loopback server closes in `finally`; the catalog case owns a unique runtime and database; the validator resets its singleton before and after; analytics cleans exact run/facet data. `API-E2E-004-BL-001` remains an unrelated broad-suite shared-database baseline: the new historical case passed in the broad run and its changed file passed `5/5` in isolation. |
| Large files remain coherent and navigable rather than mixing unrelated scenarios | Pass | The reviewed files are 197, 96, 313, and 483 lines. Each remains organized around one boundary or established suite responsibility, with descriptive grouping and localized setup/cleanup. |
| No stale, duplicated, disabled-without-reason, or compatibility-only tests remain | Pass | Exact 3.7 references prove either rejection as a current selection or preservation as historical truth. No alias, compatibility path, disabled case, or stale current-catalog expectation was introduced. The generic and exact stale-selection cases prove complementary invariants. |
| Added, updated, and removed coverage agrees with the coverage investigation and execution evidence | Pass | The diff contains two added and two updated durable paths and no removal, matching `API-REV-001`, the coverage investigation, test-case ledger, and execution report. Reported focused, broad, isolated, and blocked-live results are consistent with their assertions. |
| Test callers and fixtures exercise an independently established supported scenario rather than proving one by themselves | Pass | The scenario basis comes from approved `RER-002` requirements and the reviewed `AD-REV-001`/`ARCH-REV-001` package. Test-only servers, records, and stale identifiers only exercise those established catalog, request, rejection, history, pricing, and failure contracts. |

## Findings

None. No actionable test-code correctness, maintainability, isolation, or requirement-proof finding was identified.

- Unresolved finding IDs: `None`
- Recommended Recipient: `delivery_engineer`
- Notes: This was a proportional diff-and-evidence review; the successful API/E2E workflow was not rerun. The unrelated full-server baseline (`API-E2E-004-BL-001`), credential-gated live blocker (`API-E2E-007-ACCESS-001`), and Delivery-owned documentation synchronization remain explicitly recorded without becoming test-code findings.
