- Latest Authoritative Round: Round 1 / `ARCH-REV-001`.
- Current-State Evidence Basis: Architecture commit `f0b2f8d3fcf770e9e323d196997f7c15bd8ee0ed`; unchanged production source at requirements base `578192a1776344fa667caa29b79b4eeb8dbea290`; direct reads of the catalog, factory, current-selection, Gemini runtime/mapping/adapter/renderer, pricing-selector, token-history, GraphQL, and focused test paths named below; root lock resolution of `@google/genai@1.42.0`; and official Google 3.8 model, migration, and pricing pages rechecked on 2026-09-03. This review makes no executable-test or live-provider success claim.

## Routing Classification Review

- Task size (`Small`/`Medium`/`Large`): `Medium`
- Architectural risk (`Low`/`High`): `High`
- Classification rationale reviewed: The production change stays within three established package owners plus tests/docs, but changes an external request contract inside a Gemini adapter still shared by current 3.1 Pro.
- Independent Architecture Review required by the classification: `Yes`
- Classification evidence or correction required: No correction. `gemini-llm.ts` currently emits budget/sampling fields for all Gemini text models and merges arbitrary extras after controlled fields; an exact 3.8 branch must not alter 3.1 behavior.

## Upstream Behavior And Production-Path Basis Confirmation

- Overall Basis Status (`Confirmed`/`Contradicted`/`Blocked`): `Confirmed`
- Approved requirements / intended behavior understood: Yes — exact current 3.8 replacement, no 3.7 alias/rewrite, provider-valid 3.8 requests, observation-time pricing, and preserved supported paths.
- Relevant existing behavior and evidence confirmed: Yes — the source traces in the package match the current code at the reviewed base.
- Scope guardrail confirmed (`In-Scope Use Cases` / `Out of Scope` / `Preserved Behavior Boundary` / `Review Authority`): Yes, all four parts are explicit and internally consistent.
- Approved change, preserved behavior, and outside scope understood: Yes. The design does not introduce UI, authentication, error-policy, prompt-repair, persistence-schema, or deployment changes.
- Every prospective blocking `Design Impact` finding is traceable to an approved requirement, acceptance criterion, or preserved-behavior ID (`Yes`/`No`): `Yes` — no blocking finding remains.
- Remaining material ambiguity, if any: None.

| Behavior ID | Kind | Design Alignment With Approved Intent | Approved Trigger / Contract And Current-State Evidence | Target Outcome / Path / Spine Coherence | Status | Required Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BEH-001 | User / System | Pass | Pass — supported configuration action and static catalog query trace through package, server GraphQL, store, and form. | Pass — DS-001 spans source definition through the schema-backed selector and preserves credential independence. | Confirmed | None. |
| BEH-002 | User / Contract | Pass | Pass — supported send/tool continuation reaches `GeminiLLM`, runtime mapping, renderer, and Google SDK. | Pass — DS-002, DS-003, DS-007, and DLS-001 isolate exact 3.8 config while preserving response/tool/media/error paths and 3.1. | Confirmed | Implement and validate the specified exact-model branch. |
| BEH-003 | User / Contract | Pass | Pass — saved AutoByteus selection enters the current-membership policy; historical projection reads stored identity independently. | Pass — DS-004 and DS-008 explicitly separate stale-selection rejection from historical truth. | Confirmed | None beyond specified regressions. |
| BEH-004 | System / Contract | Pass | Pass — a token observation with `observed_at` reaches factory pricing, selector, calculator, and persisted evidence. | Pass — DS-005/DS-007 use two fixed schedules without selector or persistence changes. | Confirmed | Implement exact schedules and boundary tests. |
| BEH-005 | Operational | Pass | Pass — existing repository and credential-gated live validation entrypoints are identified. | Pass — DS-006 distinguishes deterministic results from a truthful provider-access blocker and keeps archived evidence unchanged. | Confirmed | Execute downstream validation; do not infer live success. |

## Supplemental Artifact Coherence Verdict

None — no separate supplemental task artifact applies. The investigation notes contain the canonical inventory, link the core artifacts, and mark UI/UX/prototype material `N/A — not applicable` consistently with RER-002 and AD-REV-001.

## Task Design Health Assessment Verdict

| Assessment Area | Result | Evidence | Required Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Assessment is present for the current task posture | Pass | The design classifies the work as a behavior change and identifies the shared adapter pressure. | None. |
| Root-cause classification is explicit and evidence-backed | Pass | `Shared Structure Looseness` is tied to the one current builder assuming one budget/sampling contract for 3.1 and 3.8. | None. |
| Refactor needed now / no refactor needed / deferred decision is explicit | Pass | A bounded internal `GeminiLLM` refactor is required now; generic policy machinery is rejected. | None. |
| Refactor decision is supported by the concrete design sections or residual-risk rationale | Pass | DLS-001, ownership, config invariants, final file mapping, sequence, examples, and 3.1 regression requirements all implement the decision. | None. |

## Spine Inventory Verdict

| Spine ID | Scope | Spine Is Readable? | Narrative Is Clear? | Facade Vs Governing Owner Is Clear? | Main Domain Subject Naming Is Clear? | Ownership Is Clear? | Off-Spine Concerns Stay Off Main Line? | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DS-001 | Catalog selection | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass |
| DS-002 | Normal 3.8 invocation | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass |
| DS-003 | Function-tool continuation | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass |
| DS-004 | Stale 3.7 selection | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass |
| DS-005 | Observation-time pricing | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass |
| DS-006 | Deterministic/live validation | Pass | Pass | N/A — the validation owner is itself the governing owner. | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass |
| DS-007 | Response/usage return-event | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass |
| DS-008 | Historical display return-event | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass |
| DLS-001 | Local generation-config construction | Pass | Pass | N/A — private internal spine inside `GeminiLLM`. | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass |

The six primary spines extend from supported product/system/operational triggers to meaningful outcomes; the local builder is additive rather than substituted for those paths.

## Boundary Encapsulation Verdict

| Boundary / Owner | Authoritative Public Entry Point Is Clear? | Internal Owned Mechanisms Stay Internal? | Caller Bypass Risk Is Controlled? | Verdict | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `LLMFactory` current built-in registry | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Server/web remain generic consumers; no alias or duplicate row is designed. |
| `GeminiLLM` provider adapter | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Exact-model dispatch, filtering, and adapter-owned `thinkingConfig` remain private and shared by send/stream. |
| Gemini runtime resolver/helper | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Existing mode selection stays authoritative; adapter receives only normalized `api_key`/`vertex`. |
| `GeminiPromptRenderer` | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Model-specific config cannot repair or mutate content history. |
| Token-pricing provider/selector | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Catalog supplies schedules; generic selector owns observation-time choice. |
| Application current-selection policy | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Runtime may not alias a rejected stale selection. |
| Historical/token projections | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Stored identity/totals do not consult current catalog as a translation authority. |

## Dependency Direction / Forbidden Shortcut Verdict

| Owner / Boundary | Allowed Dependencies Are Clear? | Forbidden Shortcuts Are Explicit? | Direction Is Coherent With Ownership? | Verdict | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Catalog / `LLMFactory` | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Package row feeds generic server/web projection; reverse model-specific dependencies are forbidden. |
| `GeminiLLM` | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | May use model/config, renderer, runtime helpers, SDK, and normalizers; callers cannot pre-sanitize or select policy. |
| Renderer | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Owns content turns but not generation config or history repair for unsupported scenarios. |
| Pricing | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Existing types/selectors are reused; no Gemini branch or wall-clock logic is added server-side. |
| Selection/history | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Current membership and historical display remain separate authorities. |

## Interface Boundary Verdict

| Interface / API / Query / Command / Method | Subject Is Clear? | Responsibility Is Singular? | Identity Shape Is Explicit? | Generic Boundary Risk | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `SupportedModelDefinition` row | Pass | Pass | Pass | Low | Pass |
| `LLMFactory.requireCurrentModelIdentifier` | Pass | Pass | Pass | Low | Pass |
| `resolveModelForRuntime` | Pass | Pass | Pass | Low | Pass |
| `GeminiLLM.buildGenerationConfig` | Pass | Pass | Pass | Medium before implementation, controlled by exact-model dispatch | Pass |
| Google SDK generate-content calls | Pass | Pass | Pass | Low | Pass |
| `TokenPriceConfigProvider.resolvePolicy` | Pass | Pass | Pass | Low | Pass |
| Catalog GraphQL query/projection | Pass | Pass | Pass | Low | Pass |

## Existing Capability / Subsystem Reuse Verdict

| Need / Concern | Existing Capability Area Was Checked? | Reuse / Extension Decision Is Sound? | New Support Piece Is Justified? | Verdict | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Current identity/schema/metadata | Pass | Pass | N/A | Pass | Extend the authoritative definition row. |
| Runtime provider value | Pass | Pass | N/A | Pass | Replace the existing map row. |
| 3.8 request policy | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | A private exact branch is proportionate; no generic registry is justified. |
| Tool/media continuation | Pass | Pass | N/A | Pass | Existing renderer/normalizer already owns supported paths. |
| Effective-dated pricing | Pass | Pass | N/A | Pass | Existing schedule history and selector directly express the contract. |
| Catalog projection, stale selection, history | Pass | Pass | N/A | Pass | Existing boundaries already produce the approved outcomes. |

## Subsystem / Capability-Area Allocation Verdict

| Subsystem / Capability Area | Ownership Allocation Is Clear? | Reuse / Extend / Create-New Decision Is Sound? | Supports The Right Spine Owners? | Verdict | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Built-in LLM catalog | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Owns current row, schema, metadata, and pricing payload. |
| Gemini provider adapter | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Owns model-scoped wire translation and existing invocation/return behavior. |
| Gemini runtime utilities | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Own normalized model mapping and unchanged client construction. |
| Server catalog / GraphQL | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Generic reuse; test changes only. |
| Launch validation | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Existing current-selection policy is reused. |
| Token usage / pricing / history | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Schedule-data extension with selector/projection reuse. |
| Validation / documentation | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Existing suites/harness/docs are extended without a new subsystem. |

## Reusable Owned Structures Verdict

| Repeated Structure / Logic | Extraction Need Was Evaluated? | Shared File Choice Is Sound? | Ownership Of Shared Structure Is Clear? | Verdict | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Gemini config branching | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | One existing private builder serves send/stream; another file would add indirection without reuse. |
| Exact 3.8 literal across independent contract owners | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Repetition is intentional contract evidence, not one shared mutable policy. |
| Two fixed pricing periods | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Reuses existing schedule types/selector. |
| Low/medium/high user schema | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Existing `geminiSchema` is semantically shared; request translation remains specialized. |

## Shared Structure / Data Model Tightness Verdict

| Shared Structure / Type / Schema | One Clear Meaning Per Field? | Redundant Attributes Removed? | Overlapping Representation Risk Is Controlled? | Shared Core Vs Specialized Variant / Composition Decision Is Sound? | Verdict | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `geminiSchema` | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Same user-level contract for both current Gemini rows does not imply the same wire shape. |
| `LLMModel` identity | Pass | Pass | Pass | N/A | All four current identity surfaces are exact 3.8; no alias representation. |
| `LLMConfig` to Google config translation | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Snake-case product controls terminate inside the adapter; final 3.8 config is one camel-case provider representation. |
| `TokenPricingScheduleHistory` | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Two fixed schedules replace parallel calendar logic. |
| Historical model identity | Pass | Pass | Pass | N/A | Stored 3.7 remains one truthful meaning and is not overlaid by current naming. |

## File Responsibility Mapping Verdict

| File | Responsibility Is Singular And Clear? | Responsibility Matches The Intended Owner/Boundary? | Responsibilities Were Re-Tightened After Shared-Structure Extraction? | Verdict | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `autobyteus-ts/src/llm/supported-model-definitions.ts` | Pass | Pass | N/A | Pass | One row owns exact identity/schema/metadata/base and scheduled pricing. |
| `autobyteus-ts/src/utils/gemini-model-mapping.ts` | Pass | Pass | N/A | Pass | Only normalized runtime model IDs change. |

| Server catalog/pricing/history tests | Pass | Pass | N/A | Pass | Assertions stay at their authoritative subsystem boundaries. |
| Live scenarios and active docs | Pass | Pass | N/A | Pass | Existing operational/current-product surfaces only. |

## Subsystem / Folder / File Placement Verdict

| Path / Item | Target Placement Is Clear? | Folder Matches Owning Boundary? | Mixed-Layer Or Over-Split Risk | Verdict | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `autobyteus-ts/src/llm` | Pass | Pass | Low | Pass | Current catalog/domain-control owner. |

| Test/docs/live paths | Pass | Pass | Low | Pass | Mirror the production/operational boundaries they validate. |

## Removal / Decommission Completeness Verdict

| Item / Area | Redundant / Obsolete Piece To Remove Is Named? | Replacement Owner / Structure Is Clear? | Removal / Decommission Scope Is Explicit? | Verdict | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Current 3.7 built-in row | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Replace, do not duplicate or alias. |

| Budget/sampling shape for exact 3.8 | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Retained only for non-3.8 behavior such as current 3.1 Pro. |
| Current 3.7 docs/tests/live fixtures | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Historical/stale assertions are explicitly exempted and classified. |
| Proposed 3.7 compatibility/migration machinery | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Explicitly rejected; existing current/history boundaries replace no data. |

## Legacy / Backward-Compatibility Verdict

| Area | Compatibility Wrapper / Dual-Path / Legacy Retention Exists? | Clean-Cut Removal Is Explicit? | Verdict | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Current catalog/runtime | No | Pass | Pass | No 3.7 row, alias, remap, or current pricing fallback. |
| Gemini request policy | No | Pass | Pass | The non-3.8 branch preserves a different current model contract; it is not 3.7 compatibility. |
| Saved/historical data | No | Pass | Pass | Version-agnostic readers plus exact current membership; no version branch or rewrite. |

## Persisted-Data Transition Verdict (When Applicable)

| Area / Stored Subject | Approved Decision | Representative Reader / Semantic / Invariant Evidence Is Sufficient? | Direct Use, Rebuild, Or Migration Choice Is Proportionate? | Migration Safety Is Complete If Required? | Verdict | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Saved launch/application selections | `Directly Usable — No Migration` | Pass | Pass | N/A | Pass | Stored 3.7 remains readable/editable and fails exact current selection before allocation, requiring explicit reselection. |
| Historical run/token identity, price evidence, and totals | `Directly Usable — No Migration` | Pass | Pass | N/A | Pass | Existing projections/aggregates read stored identity and cost evidence; a rewrite would violate REQ-011. |
| Static in-memory catalog | `Discard or Rebuild` through normal initialization | Pass | Pass | N/A | Pass | Normal process initialization builds the current 3.8 row; no persisted migration boundary applies. |

## Change / Refactor Safety Verdict

| Area | Sequence Is Realistic? | Temporary Seams Are Explicit? | Cleanup / Removal Is Explicit? | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dependency/type confirmation | Pass | Pass — only a narrow local cast is permitted if required by generated enum typing. | Pass — no lock churn or unjustified dependency bump. | Pass |
| Catalog/mapping replacement | Pass | Pass — no compatibility seam. | Pass — 3.7 row/map removal is first-class. | Pass |
| Adapter policy split | Pass | Pass — exact model-value discriminator and final-field ownership are explicit. | Pass — forbidden values and caller-provided controlled config are removed before adapter-owned fields are set. | Pass |
| Tests/docs/live reference update | Pass | Pass | Pass — final reference scan classifies every surviving 3.7 occurrence. | Pass |

## Example Adequacy Verdict

| Topic / Area | Example Was Needed? | Example Is Present And Clear? | Bad / Avoided Shape Is Explained When Helpful? | Verdict | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Exact model identity | Yes | Pass | Pass | Pass | Exact row and alias mismatch are contrasted. |

| Fixed pricing history | Yes | Pass | Pass | Pass | Observation-time schedules are contrasted with wall-clock branching. |
| Historical 3.7 semantics | Yes | Pass | Pass | Pass | Stored truth is contrasted with current-catalog translation. |

## Material Premise Validation (Only When Needed)

### `MP-001` — Normal product execution can produce a request history whose final turn is an unpaired model/prefill turn

- Related approved requirement or established contract: RER-002 scope guardrail; REQ-006; AC-005.
- Relevant behavior ID(s): BEH-002.
- Initiating basis kind: `User`
- Independent product-supported initiating trigger or applicable governing contract: None for the claimed malformed state. The exposed supported surfaces are the normal send action and tool-result continuation; neither exposes manual insertion of an internal trailing model turn.
- Support evidence: A normal send appends a user message through `LLMRequestAssembler`; a tool continuation preserves a provider-native model function-call turn and appends correlated user/function responses through `GeminiPromptRenderer`. Direct construction of a `Message[]` is an internal/test mechanism, not an exposed product action.
- Forward current or approved target production caller/event path that exercises the initiating basis and reaches the claimed state: No supported path reaches it. The verified paths end in a normal user prompt or correlated user/function-response turn before `GeminiLLM` invokes Google.
- Lifecycle preconditions and material consequence at the claimed point: Creating the state requires a direct/synthetic internal history that bypasses the supported send/tool lifecycle; Google could reject such a request, but no approved workflow produces it.
- Reachability: `Not Reachable`
- Review consequence / proportionate response: It cannot drive a finding or renderer-repair/retry machinery. The design correctly leaves it out of scope while retaining supported continuation tests.

## Unresolved Approved-Behavior Or Current-State Gaps

None.

## Review Decision

`Pass` — the approved behavior basis is confirmed, AD-REV-001 is actionable in the current codebase, ownership and dependency boundaries remain coherent, the no-migration decision is evidence-backed, and no in-scope mechanism or finding depends on an unsupported material premise.

## Findings

None.

## Classification

N/A — no failing finding.

## Recommended Recipient

Primary pass route: `/software_engineering_team/implementation_engineer`, subject to the exact recipient returned by the team's dynamic handoff rules. Informational pass notification: `/software_engineering_team/architecture_designer`, likewise subject to the returned informational rule.

## Residual Risks

- The isolated worktree has no installed dependencies; implementation must establish the repository-supported dependency environment before claiming build/test evidence.
- The installed/generated Google SDK type declares uppercase enum members while Google's approved JavaScript example uses lower-case strings. The design's narrow local typing seam, captured SDK-boundary tests, build, and live attempt are proportionate; no broad `any` or uppercasing is approved.
- Live Gemini 3.8 access may be blocked by credentials, entitlement, quota, region, or project setup. Deterministic request correctness remains independently testable, and downstream must report the live result truthfully.
- Any surviving active 3.7 reference could misstate support. The required classified scan and explicit historical/stale exemptions control this risk.
- A future Gemini text model with a different generation contract will require an explicit provider-adapter policy decision; this ticket does not justify a generic policy registry now.

## Latest Authoritative Result

- Review Decision: `Pass`
- Material-Premise Gate (`Pass`/`Fail`/`Blocked`): `Pass`
- Notes: `ARCH-REV-001` reviewed `AD-REV-001`; no findings. Preserve `task_size=Medium` and `architectural_risk=High` for downstream routing.
