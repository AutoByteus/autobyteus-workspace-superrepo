# Implementation Revision Record

The current code and `/home/autobyteus/workspace/.codex/worktrees/gemini-3-8-flash/tickets/done/gemini-3-8-flash/implementation-handoff.md` remain authoritative. This record is the concise implementation history.

## Revision Entries

### IR-001 — Exact Gemini 3.8 catalog and provider-contract implementation

- Triggering role, report path, and round: Architecture Reviewer; `/home/autobyteus/workspace/.codex/worktrees/gemini-3-8-flash/tickets/done/gemini-3-8-flash/design-review-report.md`; initial implementation round after Architecture Review pass.
- Triggering finding IDs: `N/A`
- Classification: `Initial Baseline`
- Prior authoritative result: `N/A`
- Current authoritative result: Implementation complete for reviewed RER-002 / AD-REV-001; exact clean-cut 3.8 replacement, exact-model request policy, fixed pricing history, focused implementation checks, and downstream Code Review route.
- Related architecture design revision IDs: `AD-REV-001`
- Related architecture-review revision IDs: `ARCH-REV-001`
- Related code-review revision IDs: `N/A`
- Related API/E2E revision IDs: `N/A`
- Related delivery revision IDs: `N/A`
- Why this baseline or implementation revision is recorded: Establishes the initial implementation handoff required after the reviewed High-risk architecture package. It records the provider-contract isolation from 3.1 Pro, no-alias/no-migration outcome, deterministic validation, and remaining downstream execution/doc responsibilities.
- Approved behavior or requirement IDs affected: `BEH-001`–`BEH-005`; `REQ-001`–`REQ-013`; `AC-001`–`AC-011`; `SCN-001`–`SCN-006`.
- Implementation delta: Replaced current catalog/mapping identity with exact 3.8; added verified metadata and introductory/standard fixed schedules; added a private exact-3.8 generation-config path with lower-case level, adapter-owned thought/tools/abort values, and forbidden-field filtering; preserved the non-3.8 budget/sampling path; updated focused current/stale/history/pricing/request/continuation assertions and active live fixture values.
- Changed files or areas: `autobyteus-ts` catalog, Gemini adapter, runtime mapping, and focused unit tests; server pricing/history unit assertions and metadata E2E target; root live-E2E scenario catalog; implementation handoff artifacts.
- Local validation and result: Frozen dependency install and core build passed; focused core suite passed 38/38; focused server unit suite passed 17/17; final catalog recheck passed 6/6; diff/lock checks passed. Repo-wide server typecheck is blocked by pre-existing TS6059 rootDir/include configuration, and the full core unit run exposed three unrelated unchanged image-client expectation failures plus retained handles.
- Next recipient or routing: Apply dynamic handoff rules for implementation result `Implementation Complete` with `task_size=Medium`, `architectural_risk=High`; selected stage is independent Code Review.
- Remaining limitations or risks: Live 3.8 access not attempted; broader API/E2E not executed; three current documentation surfaces await Delivery-owned sync; lower-case SDK typing is isolated but still requires independent review/live evidence; existing unrelated typecheck and image-test baseline failures remain.
