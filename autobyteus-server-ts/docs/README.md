# AutoByteus Server TS Documentation

This directory is the TypeScript counterpart of `autobyteus-server/docs`.

The goal is to keep architecture and module docs close to the actual Node.js/TypeScript runtime in `autobyteus-server-ts/src`, while preserving the same documentation shape used by the Python server.

## Structure

- `ARCHITECTURE.md`: system-level architecture for the TS server.
- `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`: runtime lifecycle, transport layers, and development flow.
- `URL_GENERATION_AND_ENV_STRATEGY.md`: base URL strategy and environment ownership.
- `FILE_RENDERING_AND_MEDIA_PIPELINE.md`: media and file-serving pipeline.
- `modules/`: per-module design docs, including `modules/agent_orgs.md` for coordinator-free AgentOrg composition and the flat-Team boundary, `modules/secret_management.md` for centralized credential custody and provisioning, `modules/mcp_gateway.md` for the general external MCP gateway, `modules/agent_work_traces.md` for shared readable work trace projection, and `modules/skill_improvement.md` for the manual Skill Improvement capability.
- `design/`: focused ADR-style design notes.
- `features/`: feature-level documents, including Memory Sync / Memory Hub and Remote Access / Phone Access.

## Important Runtime Constraint

Initialization order is critical in the TS server:

1. Parse CLI args.
2. Initialize `appConfigProvider` with the effective app data directory (`--data-dir`) if provided.
3. Initialize `AppConfig`.
4. Import `src/server-runtime.ts` after bootstrap completes.
5. Run migrations and start transport layers.

This ordering exists because configuration and database clients depend on environment and path state that must be finalized before services are instantiated.

See `design/startup_initialization_and_lazy_services.md` for details.

## Source of Truth

These docs should reflect the current implementation in:

- `autobyteus-server-ts/src`
- `autobyteus-server-ts/tests`

When implementation and docs diverge, implementation is authoritative until docs are updated.
